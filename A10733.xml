         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Suppoſe I am to diſpute with a man, and bee about to lay downe euery thing to his reaſon: if hee grant that hee haue reaſon, I need no further proofe of <hi>Ens:</hi> for if a man haue an eye to ſee things, there muſt bee an <hi>Ens,</hi> which muſt be the ſubiect of it; for elſe it ſhould bee in vaine: and as our outward eye were in vaine, if there were not ſome things to bee ſeene thereby; ſo were our inward eye of reaſon to no purpoſe, if there were not an <hi>ens</hi> to be ſeene. Now I will ſtand more vpon <hi>ens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will ground my Rules of Art vpon it, but that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the proper adiunct of <hi>ens,</hi> wee ſhall ſee more plainely hereafter. Yet let vs know in the meane time, that if there be reaſon, it muſt either ſee ſomething or nothing; now it cannot ſee nothing but <hi>per accidens,</hi> becauſe it properly ſeeth <hi>ens,</hi> as I ſee a man not to bee in ſuch a place, becauſe I ſee him not. True it is, that <hi>ens</hi> is the ſubiect of all Arts, but more ſpecially of Logicke, Grammar, and Rhetoricke, as they are generall: for indeed Reaſon firſt ſeeth both it ſelfe, and the other Arts.</p>
            <q>Ens eſt quod est.</q>
            <p>Now hauing found that <hi>ens</hi> is, it is requiſite that wee ſhould know what it is; and I ſay <hi>ens eſt quod eſt.</hi> If wee ſhall looke at the Grammatical notation of <hi>ens,</hi> it is a participle of the preſent tenſe, and therefore is as much as <hi>quod eſt,</hi> euen as <hi>legens</hi> and <hi>qui,</hi> or <hi>quae legis</hi> are the ſame: or as in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>verberans,</hi> or <hi>qui verberat</hi> are all one, and that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16408:3"/>
very particle doth ſhew. For if it be of the preſent tenſe, it is the ſame with the verbe of the preſent tenſe, ſo that <hi>ens</hi> and <hi>quod eſt</hi> are the ſame. Againe, if there be <hi>ens,</hi> as we haue already proued, then <hi>vel eſt quod eſt, vel non quod eſt, vel quod non eſt at neque, non quod eſt, nec quod non tſt, ergo quod eſt.</hi> For when I ſay <hi>non quod eſt,</hi> then I put <hi>ens fictum impoſſibile, ergo</hi> this can no way bee <hi>ens</hi> no not in our phantaſie; when I ſay <hi>quod non eſt,</hi> then I put <hi>ens ſictum impoſſible,</hi> and to that I giue a <hi>quod</hi> but <hi>non eſt,</hi> ſo that in the end I ſay, <hi>ens eſt, quod eſt,</hi> that is; neither <hi>ens fictum poſſibile,</hi> nor <hi>ens fictum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibile;</hi> and therefore if wee will define <hi>ens fictum impoſſibile,</hi> it is <hi>non quod eſt,</hi> if wee define <hi>ens fictum poſſibile,</hi> it is <hi>quod non eſt.</hi> Now if neither <hi>ens fictum poſſibile,</hi> nor <hi>ens fictum impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> be <hi>entia,</hi> then <hi>ens eſt quod eſt.</hi> And againe, when I deny <hi>non quod eſt,</hi> I deny <hi>eſt,</hi> and when I deny <hi>quod non eſt,</hi> I deny <hi>eſt, ergo, ens eſt quod eſt.</hi> Againe, <hi>ens</hi> and <hi>bonum</hi> are all one, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>non ens</hi> and <hi>malum</hi> are all gone, therefore <hi>ſi ens non ſit,</hi> then it is <hi>bonum</hi> and <hi>malum: ergo ens eſt quod eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Ens eſt primum vel à primo.</q>
            <p>If <hi>ens</hi> bee, it muſt bee either firſt abſolutely which is not from another, or it muſt be from a firſt, that is from another, which is not from another: againe contradiction ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, for it is as if I ſhould ſay, <hi>ens</hi> is <hi>non aliunde</hi> or <hi>aliunde;</hi> that is, it is of it ſelfe, or not of it ſelfe; and this is contradiction. But obiection may be made, that in the continuall generation of things, one thing is before another, as my father begot me, and another begot my father, and ſo in <hi>infinitum, ergo</hi> it is not neceſſary that <hi>ens</hi> ſhould bee abſolutely firſt or from a firſt. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is nothing, for am I from my father. This then hee was before I was, and I am after him, <hi>ergo</hi> here is <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>poſterius,</hi> therefore here cannot bee eternitie, <hi>ergo</hi> this <hi>ens</hi> is not eternall. Againe, is not my fathers caſe as well as mine to bee from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and ſo all men till they come to <hi>ens primum:</hi> Yes, <hi>ergo</hi> all men are from others, till wee come to this firſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute being, which is not from any other; for then he ſhould

            </p>
            <q>Ens abſolute primum eſt quod eſt ſeipſo.</q>
            <p>Firſt if there be <hi>ens primum</hi> or <hi>à primo,</hi> there muſt bee <hi>ens primum</hi> of neceſſity, for if there be <hi>ens primum,</hi> ye grant it me, if there be <hi>ens à primo,</hi> ye muſt alſo grant <hi>ens primum,</hi> therfore <hi>ens primum</hi>

For when we ſay God is <hi>ſeipſo,</hi> we doe not meane that he hath cauſes, but we meane priuatiuely that he is not <hi>aliunde,</hi> and <hi>eſt ſeipſo,</hi> and <hi>eſt</hi>

            <p>If he be <hi>ſeipſo,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is without cauſes, that that is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt muſt haue no cauſes, for then it is not abſolutely firſt, <hi>ergo</hi> there can bee no <hi>ſcientia</hi> of him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for <hi>tunc ſcire dicimur cum cauſas ſcimus.</hi> Againe, firſt if he haue no cauſes, hee hath no end, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is not made for an end, <hi>ergo</hi> there can be no art of him to guide him to an end. So that wee finde in this reſpect that <hi>ens primum</hi> cannot bee the ſubiect of Art; Euery art is to guide the thing whereof it is an art to it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Againe, it euery art doth lay forth the cauſes, effects, ſubiects and the proper adiuncts of a thing, for if it haue no cauſes it can haue no qualities, and God hath none of theſe, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is not the ſubiect of Art. Hence againe, as this <hi>ens</hi> is beyond our reaſon, ſo hee is beyond our ſpeech, either Grammar or Rhetoricke, ſo that concerning
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16408:4"/>
this <hi>ens primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> whatſoeuer we thinke or ſpeak it is imperfect. Now bring it to our Logicke after another ſort, and we ſhall ſee this <hi>ens</hi> to be beyond Art. Our Logick bringeth vs firſt to a firſt efficient, &amp; in the reſolution of any thing we go ſo far, as in the end we find a firſt efficient. Now this firſt efficient hath nothing before it, <hi>ergo</hi> that is beyond our reaſon, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what that is wee cannot tell, and therefore if wee ſhall make him an effect to looke out his cauſes, we ſhall not make him firſt, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is beyond all art; then againe there is no art but is an eternall rule in the Idea of God, as a precept of that thing whereof it is an art to guide it to its <hi>Eupraxie,</hi> therefore if there ſhould be an art of him, there muſt bee a former <hi>ens</hi> which muſt haue the Idea of it, to ſhew how this <hi>ens primum</hi> was made, and whereby it muſt bee gouerned: ſo that he is not the ſubiect of our reaſon; ſo that whereas I ſaid before, that <hi>ens</hi> was the ſubiect of our reaſon, here I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call it, and ſay that <hi>primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ens</hi> is beyond our Logick: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being beyond all art, wee will goe them ouer more briefly, till we come to <hi>ens à primo.</hi> Firſt then, he is without efficient, for he is without cauſes, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is vncreated: for the firſt matter, though it were without matter, and forme, yet it had an efficient, and an end, <hi>ergo</hi> was created: then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he is <hi>ſeipſo, ergo</hi> he muſt be vncreated, hence alſo hee cannot be annihilated, neither generated, nor corrupted: againe, hence he is <hi>independens aliunde,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum:</hi> againe, hence he is without matter: Now if hee bee without matter, therefore he is without <hi>genus, ergo</hi> is not a <hi>ſpecies</hi> either <hi>ſubalterna,</hi> or <hi>ſpecialiſſima.</hi> Againe, if hee bee without forme as without <hi>genus,</hi> then he cannot be defined, <hi>ergo</hi> he muſt bee without limitation of eſſence, <hi>ergo</hi> without limitation of quantity, <hi>ergo</hi> without limitation of place, and becauſe he is without beginning from any other thing, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is without any duration, and becauſe hee is without any matter, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is truely ſpirituall, for ſo wee account things ſpirituall, according to the ſubtlenes of their matter, but he hath no matter at all: againe he being without matter and forme, <hi>ergo</hi> can be no <hi>membrum,</hi> becauſe euery member
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16408:4"/>
containeth a portion of matter and forme, neither can he be an <hi>integrum,</hi> becauſe that conſiſteth of members, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine part of matter, and forme. Now in that he is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt, therefore he can be but <hi>vnum,</hi> for elſe there ſhould be more: againe if there ſhould bee more then one, then the one would ſay as well as the other, I am as forward as thee, and ſo none could be abſolutely firſt. Againe he is no <hi>genus,</hi> for that is an vniuerſall, or Synopſis of many together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he is but one: ſo that now he is not properly an <hi>ens,</hi> but an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and aboue our Logicke: againe, in that hee is abſolutely firſt he muſt needs bee without accidents (to vſe their terme) without adiuncts, for they are ſecond things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from their ſubſtances, and <hi>in abſolutè primo ente</hi> there muſt be nothing, but that which is <hi>abſolutè primum:</hi> ſo that here we ſee his moſt ſimple being, and that he is beyond our Logicke. Now if he be without all <hi>potentia,</hi> both <hi>eſſentialis,</hi> and <hi>accidentalis,</hi> hee is pure act; ſo that this act now of his muſt needs be his <hi>eſſae,</hi> becauſe he is pure act, for if he bee <hi>agere,</hi> then his <hi>eſſe,</hi> and <hi>agere</hi> are the ſame: ſo that if any one doth any thing, as euery <hi>ens à primo</hi> doth by <hi>potentia,</hi> it is not pure act: ſome ſay the Angels doe <hi>agere per eſſentiam,</hi> but it is falſe, vnleſſe they meane that they act firſt by <hi>potentia:</hi> now indeed there is nothing, but it doth act <hi>per facultatem eſſentiae.</hi> Firſt the forme, that is the beginner of act, and when it acts vpon matter internall, that is habituall, or a faculty, when it acts by the matter vpon ſome externall obiect, that is an act; for firſt there is the eſſence, the matter, and the forme, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faculty, the formes act vpon the matter internally; laſtly, the act, which is of the forme, by the matter externally: now theſe are not in God, but are his very eſſence. Now we find then, that this <hi>primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ens</hi> muſt be <hi>actus,</hi> &amp; <hi>purus actus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no <hi>potentia</hi> in him at all, <hi>ergo</hi> it muſt needs bee, that he is <hi>primus actus, ergo optimus actus,</hi> for <hi>primus actus,</hi> and <hi>optimus actus</hi> are all one: Againe hence it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if there bee any act of other things, it muſt needs bee from him, and therefore if there be any thing <hi>actu</hi> it muſt be from him: ſo then thus we haue found him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in euery thing.</p>

            <p>Now to returne to the firſt Syllogiſme. If there be reaſon, there muſt bee an <hi>adaequatum ſubiectum</hi> of it, <hi>ergo ens à primo,</hi> for we haue heard that <hi>ens primum</hi> is beyond our reaſon, ſo that there muſt be <hi>ens à primo,</hi> which is <hi>adaequatum ſubiectum rationi,,</hi> and that now is liable to all our Logicke, for it hath cauſes, effects, ſubiects, adiuncts, &amp;c. and thus we will goe on, and ſee all the ſubiects of the arts in the concretion of <hi>ens à primo,</hi> which the Philoſophers ſay, cannot bee demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
            <p>That we might dig deepe, and lay our foundation of Arts ſure, I haue ſhewed that there is a being, and that it is double, the one from whom art is, the other in whom it ſhines, now we heard that <hi>ens eſt quod eſt,</hi> which is nothing but the true notation of <hi>ens</hi> reſolued by Grammar <hi>quod eſt.</hi> Now for the continuall ſucceſſion of things which ſome dreame of, this it is, if all things bee effects, there muſt bee ſo many cauſes, <hi>ergo</hi> in the end wee ſhall come to a firſt cauſe, that is not <hi>effectum:</hi> Further wee heard that <hi>ens primum,</hi> was <hi>quod eſt ſeipſo,</hi> that is without any other: ſo that in propriety hee is neither <hi>eſſentia,</hi> nor <hi>ens</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Hence he neither hath cauſes, neither is any argument that doth ariſe from cauſes, <hi>ergo</hi> is an <hi>indiuiduum,</hi> but not a <hi>ſpecies:</hi> hee is without end, <hi>ergo</hi> he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: hence he therefore was neuer made, <hi>ergo</hi> he made all things: hee is without definition, diſtribution, and properties, becauſe he is without cauſes, <hi>ergo</hi> there can be no art of him, but he muſt bee the Author of art, as wee ſhall heare hereafter. He is <hi>merus actus,</hi> becauſe hee is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>potentia,</hi> both <hi>ſubſtantialis,</hi> and <hi>accidentalis,</hi> againe hee is <hi>primus actus, ergo optimus actus, ergo</hi> whatſoeuer is well done of any thing is firſt from him, againe he is <hi>infinitus actus, ergo</hi> able to doe any finite thing, yea, and infinite.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ens à primo</hi> muſt bee both like, and vnlike <hi>primum:</hi> ſo the world is one, <hi>ergo</hi> like God, it is made of many ſimples, <hi>ergo</hi> vnlike him: ſo euery thing is one, <hi>ergo</hi> like God, but is <hi>concretum, ergo</hi> is vnlike him: ſo that euery creature muſt take a blow of God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> when he wreſtled with the Angel tooke a blow on the hip, though hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, whereby he was made lame. Againe our Logicke tels vs firſt of ſimples, and then of the diſpoſing of them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ens à primo</hi> muſt be <hi>concretum</hi> of ſimples, becauſe it muſt be liable to our reaſon; ſo that as before there was <hi>ens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was reaſon, ſo here this <hi>ens,</hi> which is the ſubiect of our reaſon muſt be <hi>concretum,</hi> becauſe I muſt ſee it with my eye of Logicke.

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the reaſon of it is this, this <hi>ens</hi> though it be for God, yet it is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for man, as wee may ſee through all the creatures of God, <hi>ergo</hi> wee thus conclude, that euery thing was made for man, and man for God; for wee know that euery thing conſiſts of matter, and forme, and the end of the matter and forme of a thing is to make vp the effect, and thus wee ſay, euery thing is it owne end. Now then in euery <hi>ente à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> there muſt be an <hi>actus</hi> to cary it to man, and an <hi>actum,</hi> that is, that that is caried, that that is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; for as colour acts the externall thing to my externall eye, and is about the thing, ſo this <hi>actus</hi> doth to my reaſon, and is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, about euery thing, and is an obiect of my eye of reaſon, though it ariſeth from the thing, and flieth about it. Now this <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: ſo that Logicke is <hi>concreſcus</hi> with Logicke, and with Grammar, and Rhetoricke, &amp;c. And hence it is called <hi>commune,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>concreſcens</hi> with <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of it, and theſe are the <hi>actus</hi> of the thing: for I ſee euery thing by my Logicke, and that ſees nothing but arguments, axioms, ſyllogiſmes, and method; <hi>ergo,</hi> I can ſee nothing but that that it doth thus dictate to my reaſon; <hi>ergo,</hi> Logicke doth act the <hi>actum,</hi> or that which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to my reaſon. Now then there muſt be reaſon in euery thing, becauſe I am to ſee euery thing by my Logicke, which is the rule of reaſon, <hi>ergo</hi> all things muſt be lyable to it, <hi>ergo</hi> it muſt apprehend the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in euery thing, becauſe though all things at the beginning were made for one man, yet by reaſon of ſinne ſince his fall, one cannot ſee all things, therefore there muſt be a carrier from one man to another, that which one man ſees with his eye of Logicke, hee may vtter it to another: ſo that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <hi>actus rei ad hominem,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is <hi>actus rei ab homine ad hominem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is eyther <hi>loquentia</hi> or <hi>eloquentia:</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this diſtribution is this, wee heard before that ſpeech was a carrier from man to man; and becauſe things that are reported, are not ſo eaſily receiued, as thoſe which are ſeene by our eye of <hi>Logicke, ergo</hi> it was requiſite that there ſhould not onely be an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whereby things might be vttered, but alſo a fine ſugering of them with Rhetoricke, for the more eaſie receiuing of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eloquentia</hi> is eyther more fine or more graue; that is, <hi>ſoluta,</hi> or <hi>ligata:</hi> the reaſon is this, <hi>argumentum</hi> is <hi>artificiale,</hi> or <hi>inar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiale:</hi> now becauſe ſpeech is an inartificiall argument, and ſo not eaſily receiued, therefore Rhetoricke ſerues to deliuer the matter more ſoberly and grauely; and Poetry yet makes it more fine, where all things muſt be done by meaſure and ſweet ſounds.</p>
            <p>So that now we ſee how theſe generall Arts are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16408:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that they are not of ſo great neceſſitie in reſpect of the thing, as in regard of vs for our good: for, ſo as euery thing is made for man, ſo he muſt ſee them for his good, by that rule that they are created.</p>
            <p>Theſe now though they be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe they are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall, yet they are <hi>ab ente primo,</hi> becauſe there are cauſes, effects, ſubiects, adiuncts, &amp;c. and ſpeech <hi>in ente à primo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is eyther quantitie or qualitie, the reaſon is this, euery <hi>ens à primo</hi> is finite, <hi>ergo</hi> muſt needs haue limits of quantitie, if he haue limits of eſſence.</p>
            <p>Quantitie is eyther diſcreet, or continued, for if euery thing be finite, then it muſt be diſcreet, or diſtinct from any other. Againe, as it is diſcreet, ſo it is continued, ſo farre as the forme extendeth the matter, whereby wee may ſee how farre it reacheth, and where it reacheth not. Now as there is quantitie, ſo alſo there muſt be qualitie in euery thing, for there is no <hi>ens à primo</hi> that is pure act, <hi>ergo</hi> it hath a forme act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon a matter, &amp; thence proceed all quantities. Againe, it being made for an end, muſt therefore act vnto its end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qualitas eſt natura, &amp; bonitas,</hi> euery thing hath nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath a matter and a forme, <hi>ergo</hi> there is nature in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing. And therefore <hi>Ramus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Forma eſt praecipua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum natura:</hi> and the Philoſophers call <hi>forma principium actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> and <hi>materia principium paſſionis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>ens</hi> being of this ſcantling for quantitie, and of this nature for act, muſt be good for Gods glory: ſo that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing hath a goodneſſe in it. Againe, were all things made for man, and muſt hee ſee them with his reaſon? Yes: <hi>ergo</hi> they are good for him: <hi>ergo</hi> hee muſt haue a will to imbrace them as <hi>bona,</hi> as well as an eye of reaſon to ſee them as <hi>vera,</hi> and ſo man alſo is made for God, as his will acts goodnes.</p>
            <p>Now for the order of theſe, <hi>actus</hi> is before <hi>actum:</hi> for the one is <hi>actio,</hi> the other is <hi>paſsio,</hi> and <hi>actio</hi> is before <hi>paſsio,</hi> and is more excellent then it. Againe, <hi>actus</hi> doth <hi>concreſcere</hi> with it ſelfe, and with the <hi>actum</hi> that is in the thing: <hi>ergo, actus</hi> is more generall; <hi>ergo</hi> is before <hi>actum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, becauſe wee doe not giue names to things but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16408:7"/>
with reaſon from ſome argument of Logicke in the thing: and againe, becauſe there muſt be an <hi>actus</hi> from the thing to man, before there can be an <hi>actus</hi> from man to man, therefore the <hi>Logiſmes</hi> in the thing muſt be before the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in it; <hi>ergo</hi> Logicke is the moſt generall, and firſt in order of all arts.</p>
            <p>Of thoſe things that are <hi>acta,</hi> quantitie is firſt, becauſe it ariſeth nexly from the matter, and forme of a thing: for firſt of all the matter, and forme limit the thing, when they are put together, before they act any thing, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they act one vpon the other. Now qualitie, that is the act of the forme vpon the matter; <hi>ergo,</hi> it is after quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, but before goodneſſe, becauſe that is the end of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures act. For ſeeing quantitie ariſeth immediately from the matter and forme of a thing, and nature from the act of the forme vpon the matter: therefore goodneſſe muſt be the laſt, as being the end of all the former: and thus did the Lord make all things, firſt making the cauſes effects of things, then impoſing ſpeech on them, then number, then meaſuring them by Geometrie, how farre their magnitude ſhould reach, and where it ſhould not reach, before it ſhould act. Now this act of Nature was to goe no further vpon externall obiects, but onely be acted by the forme vpon the matter; whereas the morall act of goodnes was to goe further, for that is for God. Againe, Nature is the next inmoſt thing to quantitie, and Goodnes is laſt. And thus haue we ſeene all that is <hi>in ente à primo,</hi> which is the ground of all Arts.</p>
            <q>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>Now wee are come to Arts, and firſt wee are to beginne with Encuclopaidia, and the definition of it. Firſt for the name, it is <hi>Orbis ille, &amp; Circulus Artium.</hi> The reaſon of it indeed is as much as Arts quite through, as wee vſe to ſay when there are many poore folke to bee ſerued, though
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16408:8"/>
they ſtand in a long row, Haue you ſerued them round? But there is a further reaſon of it, A circle wee know is a round line, whoſe beginning and end meet together in a common point; therefore this learning in a Circle muſt be ſhewed to haue a common point, and that wee ſhall eaſily finde. The proper ſubiect of Art is <hi>Ens à primo,</hi> becauſe we heard, that was made for an end. Now then from whence <hi>Ens à primo</hi> had his beginning, from thence muſt <hi>Ars</hi> haue his beginning: But from <hi>Ens primum</hi> it had his beginning, <hi>ergo.</hi> Againe, as <hi>Ens à primo</hi> hath for his beginning <hi>Ens primum,</hi> ſo it muſt haue <hi>Ens primum</hi> for his laſt end, becauſe <hi>Ens primum</hi> is not made for any end, but is the laſt end of all things it ſelfe, <hi>ergo</hi> hee muſt alſo be the laſt end of Arte: Then here wee finde, as <hi>Ens primum</hi> is the beginning of Art, ſo alſo hee is the end of Art; becauſe he is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and end of thoſe things that are the ſubiects of arts; therefore there is one common point wherein they begin and end: <hi>ergo</hi> hauing the ſame beginning and end, here is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now howſoeuer the phraſe may ſeeme otherwiſe, as wee heard before, yet here wee ſee the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in this name, though the Graecians did not know the reaſon of it when they gaue it. Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemeth to witneſſe this truth. For the Lord ſaith, <hi>I am the beginning and the end:</hi> that is, of things. And againe, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega:</hi> theſe belong to Grammar, <hi>ergo</hi> to Art, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is both the beginning and end of things, and the Alpha and Omega of the Arts.</p>
            <p>That this wiſedome is round, we may alſo ſee in regard of the ſubiect; for the World is round, and that is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of Art: <hi>ergo</hi> Art is ſo, for Art is an adiunct to it, and euery adiunct takes figure of his ſubiect. Againe, if we will take Art for Knowledge, Knowledge is in a mans head, and that is round, ſo <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is euery way <hi>in circulo:</hi> and thus wee ſee the reaſon, why this name ſhould bee giuen to a Chaine, whoſe linkes are the Arts. Now if <hi>Ens primum</hi> be the cauſe of <hi>entia à primo,</hi> then he hath the Idea of them in him: for he made them by counſell, and not by

neceſſity; for then he ſhould haue needed them, and they haue a parelion of that wiſedome that is in his Idea. Again, it muſt needs be that this wiſedome is his, becauſe hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes them by the rules of Art, for ſo euery rule of Art is a Statute-law of God, by which hee made the things, and whereby hee gouernes the things, whoſe art it is. Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo, therefore this Law hath God for the author, and looke what Idea was in the making of the thing, the ſame Idea is in the gouerning of it: for if the Lord ſhould make it by one rule, and gouerne it by another, it would not ſerue the turne to guide the thing to the <hi>eupraxie,</hi> whereunto it was made. So that hence it followes, that euery rule of Art is eternall. Againe our rule of Logicke tells vs, that euery rule of Art is moſt true, and therefore is from God. For ſo euery rule is true, as it anſwers to that Idea that is in him: and is moſt iuſt, moſt wiſe; <hi>ergo</hi> is from God, who is moſt true, moſt iuſt, and moſt wiſe. Now it is in God as in the fountaine, &amp; it is in the creature too, but there it is by a refraction: for this wiſedome comming to the creature, according as the creature is, ſuch is the Arts order and courſe. So that if <hi>ens à primo</hi> be diuided into parts, this wiſedome alſo will be diuided into parts: and as in a Looking-glaſſe that is broken, looke how many pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it is broken into, ſo many images ſhall you ſee: So for the Arts, looke into how many parts the thing is diuided, into ſo many parts will the Art be diſtributed.</p>

So when I ſay <hi>Dialectica eſt ars bene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerendi,</hi> I doe not define Logicke, but I define the frame of reaſon: ſo that the parelion is the frame of the thing, and thence are the Arts written, and by the Art wee ſee the frame: ſo then <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is the wiſedome of God in the thing, <hi>ergo</hi> the ſubiect of <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is <hi>Ars,</hi> that is the Frame of things.</p>

            <p>The Chaine <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is not a <hi>genus</hi> to <hi>ars,</hi> no more then a Chaine is a <hi>genus</hi> to the Linkes, but an <hi>integrum:</hi> for as a Chaine is an <hi>integrum,</hi> and the Linkes <hi>membra;</hi> ſo <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuclopaidia</hi> is an <hi>integrum,</hi> and the Arts are the members that make vp the whole. Now as the linkes muſt be linked together, before there be a Chaine: ſo the Arts muſt be holden together, before there bee <hi>Encuclopaidia:</hi> ſo that euery Art is a linke, and they muſt be linked together to make vp the whole. Therefore I ſay, <hi>qua continentur,</hi> as parts, <hi>continentur à toto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Arts may be holden together; for there is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie among the Arts, for <hi>Ars in genere</hi> is <hi>genus</hi> to them all: Therefore as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, they haue a certaine common kinred, as being <hi>ſpecies</hi> of one <hi>genus:</hi> but this holding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is after another manner then linkes in a Chaine; namely, <hi>pro ſubordinatione finium:</hi> Therefore they are not holden together confuſedly, and as they come to hand, but euery one muſt haue his ranke according to the generalitie of the end thereof. So that if wee linke Grammar on the Chaine before Logicke, wee doe not right: and ſo in like ſort for the other Arts.</p>
            <p>I ſay, <hi>qua omnes artes,</hi> becauſe as a Chaine that hath not all his linkes, is not perfect, becauſe it wants ſome parts: ſo the Chaine of Arts will not be perfect, if there be any wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; the rule of Logicke teacheth vs ſo much: for <hi>Encu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopaidia</hi> is a <hi>totum, ergo</hi> if any <hi>membra</hi> be wanting, there will not be a <hi>totum</hi> made vp.

               <hi>Fabrico,</hi> becauſe it is ſeene in the frame of the thing.

            <p>Againe, to call it an habit as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith it is, and as the Schooles make it, that conceit is very ſimple, for <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> or <hi>quantitas habitualis</hi> belongeth to Logicke, and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſpeciall kinde of adiunct: therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth define <hi>homo</hi> to be <hi>genus rationale,</hi> whereas wee know <hi>genus</hi> is but an adiunct <hi>animal,</hi> which is the <hi>genus</hi> of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo:</hi> ſo that it is not Art in the thing, but the knowledge he hath of it, which is adioyned to man. Now wee haue heard, that Art is the wiſedome of God, <hi>in ente à primo,</hi> and the frame of the creature is in the antitype of this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and is a ſubiect of Art.

Againe, thoſe parts
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16408:10"/>
muſt <hi>conſtare,</hi> for in the frame of the thing the ſubiects of the Arts doe <hi>conſtare, ergo</hi> this wiſedome following them muſt <hi>conſtare</hi> in his parts: and as one thing hath his frame, and another his, differing from the other; hence the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Arts muſt be various, and muſt <hi>conſtare</hi> one with another; hence it followes, that in Art wee muſt haue no rules but thoſe that will <hi>conſtare,</hi> and are eſſentiall to it. So that if wee bring a rule af Grammar into Logicke, or <hi>è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trá:</hi> or if wee leaue out of Logicke ſome eſſentiall rule to it, it will not <hi>conſtare:</hi> againe if the rules of Art be diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they will not ſtand together: therfore when I ſay <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtare,</hi> I ſay two things, firſt that euery Art muſt haue all the rules, that are eſſentiall to it, and no more: &amp; ſecondly, that euery precept muſt be placed in his due order, and rancke. For as a Painter that makes the picture of a man would make it verie deformed, if hee ſhould ſet the head where the feet ſhould bee, or <hi>contra:</hi> ſo were it as abſurd for an Artiſt to diſorder his Art.</p>
            <q>Conſtat praeceptis.</q>
            <p>Euery thing hath his ſpeciall acts before it can work that maine act, for which it was made, as reaſon muſt haue two parts, it muſt ſee the ſimple cauſes, effects, ſubiects, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts, &amp;c. and Axiomes, Syllogiſmes, and Method, that it may <hi>benè diſſerere,</hi> therefore there are many pettie acts of reaſon to be performed, which though they all conſpire in one maine act, yet are they not one another: and here we ſee, that as Arts did ariſe from the frame of the thing: ſo the precepts of Art are from the Acts of things: ſo that thus Arts <hi>conſtant praeceptis</hi> or <hi>regulis,</hi> all is one, both are good, &amp; <hi>regere</hi> is as large as <hi>regula,</hi> and <hi>praeceptum</hi> as <hi>praecipere.</hi> But my reaſon why I rather chuſe <hi>praeceptum</hi> is this, becauſe <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi> is tropicall, for it is often taken for a Square or Rular, whereby we rule any thing, and this is a grand Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.

               </gap>, as at the Creation, when the Lord ſaid, Let there be light, by this rule, as by a Precept did the Lord create light, and alſo gouerns it. It is a Law as God gouernes reaſon, ſpeech, quantity, &amp;c. by the rule of Logick, Grammar, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and euen as a King gouerneth his Dominions by his Lawes: ſo the Lord gouerneth his Creatures by the rules of Arts: and becauſe the Creation began with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, therefore we ſtill hold it, and they may bee called Lawes, Statutes or Commandements, &amp;c. euen as the Lord calleth his Lawes for man Commandements. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I rather call the rules of Arts <hi>praecepta,</hi> then <hi>regulae,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they being ſhortly deliuered are as ſo many ſhort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the guiding of the thing to the end thereof.</p>
            <q>Primè veriſsimèque ſcientificis.</q>
            <p>Euery Precept of Art, muſt be <hi>ſcientificum,</hi> that is making knowledge: <hi>ſcientia</hi> (ſaith our Logick) is the iudgement of a neceſſarie Axiome, and therefore muſt bee ſo true, ſo iuſt, and ſo wiſe, as nothing can bee more true, more iuſt, more vviſe. Why? ſo are the Precepts of Art both in God, and in the Creature, for as for deductions the Lord hath ſhut them vp in a briefe rule of Art; for looke how many vſes there may be of a rule of Art in the thing whoſe rule it is, ſo many deductions will there ariſe from that rule. Now man not being able to take this wiſdome from God, which is moſt ſimple, therefore it hath pleaſed the Lord to place it in the things, and as flowers doe ſend out a ſent, or odor that doth affect our ſenſe of ſmelling, ſo eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precept of Art doth <hi>ſpirare</hi> a ſweet ſcience to our glaſſe of Vnderſtanding, which is indeed that irradiation, which we heard of in Diuinity in the Creation of things: but it is called <hi>ſcientia</hi> by a Trope, for as the ſent of a flower is not properly odor, but that that doth affect the ſenſe; and as when we ſee a ſtrange thing, we ſay, looke what a ſight is yonder, whereas ſight is properly of the eye: ſo wee
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16408:11"/>
call Art a <hi>ſcientia,</hi> or ſweet ſauour in reſpect of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, which is a metonimy of the adiunct for the Subiect.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee haue heard how they are in the things, and from thence they doe come by an irradiation, to the Glaſſe of our vnderſtanding, and as the Sunne beames comming through a redde or blew glaſſe, &amp;c. will bring the colour of the glaſſe with them to our ſenſe: ſo doth the irradiation of Art from the thing bring the colour of the thing with it to our vnderſtanding. I meane that this irradiation doth bring the frame of the thing with it, according to which we ſee it. Now then firſt it is called the wiſedome of God, as it is one in him, then is it called <hi>ars,</hi> as it is in the thing, and when it is brought by an irradiation to our vnderſtanding, the firſt Act of it is to ſee the ſimples in the things, and this is called our <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia,</hi> for it is that perſpicacie whereby wee looke at the inuention that is in the thing: ſo that it is the firſt Act of our <hi>intellectus.</hi> As it is receiued in an axiome, we call it <hi>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.</hi> It is our <hi>ſapie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia</hi> as we can diſcourſe with it ſyllogiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: &amp; as we apply it rightly in time, and place, ſo it is <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia.</hi> And it is <hi>Ars</hi> as we can execute it, and practiſe it in <hi>Analyſi</hi> or <hi>Geneſi,</hi> as <hi>Ars</hi> is rightly an intellectual vertue, as we teach it to another it is <hi>doctrina,</hi> and his learning is <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplina;</hi> laſtly, as we ſet it downe in writing or printing, it is <hi>liber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And euery rule of Art is true, as when I ſay, <hi>Roſa eſt flos, Socrates eſt homo,</hi> though there be neuer a Roſe or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in the world, becauſe the rule is eternall, for it is in the eternall Idea of God, though the thing be not. Now ſome Meta-Phiſitians, not diſtinguiſhing aright hereof, ſay the thing is eternall, that is (ſay they) the thing was in Gods eternall Idea; nay the Idea of God is eternall, but not the thing. I but <hi>Kickerman</hi> ſaith, the thing is eternall <hi>quoad eſſentiam,</hi> not <hi>quoad exiſtentiam,</hi> but that is falſe, for

               <hi>exiſtere</hi> belongs to <hi>effectum</hi> in Logick, and euery effect muſt haue all the cauſes, <hi>ergo</hi> matter, and forme, and theſe are not eternall.</p>
            <q>Primè,</q>
            <p>For there is no rule of Art, but is a neceſſary Axiome in its owne place, and ſo is firſtly true. Now deductions are true but at the firſt, ſecond, third, or fourth hand, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are drawne from the firſt rule, at the ſecond, third, or fourth hand, and are ſo far forth true, as the firſt rule is true; therefore when we diſpute with any Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we bring our controuerſie to a rule of Art, and if they deny that, wee ſay <hi>contra negantem principia, non eſt diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum,</hi> though there is no rule of Art but may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and is firſt becauſe it deliuereth the firſt cauſes of the things.</p>
            <q>veriſsimèque,</q>
            <p>Euerie rule of Art as it is <hi>prima ſcientia,</hi> ſo it is <hi>veriſſima:</hi> but for deductions, as they are <hi>ſecundae,</hi> or <hi>tertiae ſcientiae,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they ariſe from the firſt rule, ſo they are <hi>ſecundo,</hi> or <hi>tertio</hi> true, to wit, ſo farre forth as the firſt is true.</p>

Now for practicke they ſay they are ſuch as doe only prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and leaue no worke behinde them: or they are alſo poieticke, and leaue a worke behinde them. Of the firſt ſort they make Ethickes, Oeconomickes, Politicks, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, Optickes, and others.

much, for there is <hi>ſcriptio,</hi> and <hi>ſcriptum;</hi> ſo in Arithmetick there is a numbring, and a thing numbred. So for Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry there is a meaſuring, and a thing meaſured: and ſo for all other arts. And it cannot be otherwiſe by the rule of Grammar, for euery verbe is a tranſitiue, and that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actiue, or neuter, and both of them gouerne an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiue caſe, which is rhe ſubiect into which they paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as <hi>amo patrem, Pater</hi> is the ſubiect vnto which <hi>amo</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ouer: and <hi>ſero</hi> a verbe neuter hath his ſubiect in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as when I ſay, I ſow, it is as if I ſhould ſay, I ſow ſeed. therefore there is a <hi>prattomenon</hi> of euery Art, as well as a <hi>praxis.</hi> For if a man ſmels, he ſmels ſomething, and when hee ſees, hee ſees ſomething, and drinking, hee drinkes drinke.</p>
            <q>Praxis eſt artis in agendo motus.</q>
            <p>There is nothing that can act <hi>ſine motu,</hi> but only God: and hence it is that <hi>motus</hi> is generall to euery effect, and therefore is an effect by our rule of Logicke.</p>
            <q>Praxis <hi>is</hi> Geneſis, <hi>and</hi> Analyſis.</q>
            <p>Theſe two belong to art in like ſort, becauſe they belong to the thing where Art is, for if you grant a <hi>motus</hi> of euery thing, it muſt either be from principles to the making vp of a thing, or to the reſoluing of it. Now if Art make vp a thing, it can alſo vndoe it, for the way is the ſame, onely there is a progreſſe, and regreſſe: ſo if I by my rule of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar ioyne a nominatiue caſe, and a verbe together, I can alſo by the ſame rule vndoe them againe, and ſee whether it be true; and this we call conſtruing of Latine, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> indeed is diſtruing, for it is Analyſis, for we pull that aſunder, which <hi>Tully</hi> hath layd together, and indeed no ne can well vndoe a thing, but he that made it, or one that knowes how to make it: and therefore we doe not ſend for a Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to pull downe a houſe, but for a Carpenter, <hi>ergo</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:16408:14"/>
if euery thing haue his <hi>Geneſis</hi> and <hi>Analyſis</hi> Art muſt alſo haue them, which follow the thing.</p>
            <q>Geneſis eſt progreſſus artis a ſimplicibus ad compoſita.</q>
            <p>This Art hath his <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which is a progreſſe, for <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> begins at the ſimples, and ſo goes to the compoſites, therefore muſt needs be a progreſſe, now euery thing but God is compoſed of ſimples, therefore there muſt needes be a <hi>Geneſis</hi> of euery Art which ſtill followes the thing. So Logicke firſt lookes at the inuention of things, then at the axioms, ſyllogiſmes, and method. So Grammar firſt begins with letters, then with ſyllables, then with words, then with ſentences: and Arithmeticke firſt conſidereth ſimple number, then comparatiue, &amp;c. So Geometry firſt lookes at lines, then at ſuperficies, then at <hi>corpus:</hi> ſo naturall Philoſophy firſt begins with ſimple natures, then with compoſites, firſt with thoſe that are without life, then thoſe that liue, firſt a ſimple life, ſecondly thoſe that liue a compoſite life.</p>
            <q>Analyſis eſt regreſſus a compoſitis ad ſimplicia.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Analyſis</hi> is an vnwinding of a bottome of thred, which we wound vp before: ſo we analyſe that which was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed before, ſo that it is a <hi>regreſsio, &amp;c.</hi> for that way that you tooke in <hi>geneſi,</hi> the ſame way you take in <hi>analyſi,</hi> onely you begin at diuers ends. So in Logicke wee take an axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome, and reſolue it into arguments, and ſo in Grammar we take a ſentence, and reſolue it into words, and ſo when I aske what a word ſignifies, he that telleth me the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it doth analyſe it, and ſo for the other arts as wee heard before in the doctrine of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Now the Schooles thought that <hi>geneſis</hi> and <hi>analyſis</hi> belong to Method in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, which happily they might haue from <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> who intituleth his bookes <hi>Analytickes,</hi> and thence they make method to be double <gap reason="foreign">

and againe, there is <hi>geneſis,</hi> and <hi>analyſis</hi> of one and the ſame axiome, as when I ſeeke for a cauſe, or any other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make an axiome, or when I reſolue it into a cauſe, &amp;c. ſo that when I aske, what is Latine for ſuch a word, I geniſe it, and engliſhing it I analyſe it, ſo that they belong not to method, which is a diſpoſition, for they may be of one word; againe, they may be as well of any other rule as of method. Now becauſe they did obſerue the <hi>analyſis</hi> and <hi>geneſis</hi> in method more vſually, then of art in generall, therefore they thought them to belong onely to it; now indeed if I take any rule of art from other rules of art, I practiſe method, therefore they may bee ſpeciall practiſes of method, for as I ſaid before they may be in any other rule of Art, as well as in it. And method is not dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe of them, no more then any rule of Art is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe of the double vſe of it, and theſe are the life of Art, therefore thoſe that will be expert for practice of any Art, let them practiſe theſe. Now for the generall arts, I thinke none will doubt, but that they belong to them, but for the ſpeciall arts there may be ſome doubt. If you draw any deduction from any firſt rule of any ſpeciall Art, it is <hi>geneſis;</hi> or if you draw deduction vnto a firſt rule from it, it is <hi>analyſis, &amp;c.</hi> So when you examine the Sunnes courſe by the rule of Aſtronomie, it is <hi>geneſis, analyſis contra.</hi> This <hi>analyſis</hi> if it be imitated (for ſo it pleaſeth the Lord to let vs reſolue his creatures) that we may worke alike, that is called <hi>imitatio:</hi> ſo that thoſe that haue writ ſo much of <hi>imitatio,</hi> are to bring it hither, and <hi>imitatio</hi> is generall, as we imitate ſome <hi>analyſis</hi> of ſomething that is geniſed. And indeed all our practice is nothing but <hi>geneſis</hi> imitatiue of <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>Prattomenon</hi> is that that the Art hath done by his <hi>praxis,</hi> for <hi>actio</hi> muſt goe before <hi>paſſio,</hi> and <hi>praxis</hi> is before <hi>pratto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi> and there is nothing, but it is made for man, and therefore muſt haue a <hi>prattomenon,</hi> for elſe the motion of it would be little worth: now to <hi>prattomenon</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs two things, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, for when Art hath acted, and acted a worke, it reſteth not there, for it is for an vſe, therefore there muſt goe with <hi>prattomenon,</hi> an vſe thereof. Now this vſe may bee confuſed with the <hi>pratto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of other arts; ſo that this rule is here to bee taught, that the arts for their precepts are diſtinct, but not for the vſe of their <hi>prattomena:</hi> for vſe holds the <hi>prattomena</hi> of arts together, as in this example, all fleſh is graſſe, if it be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For in this there is the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of Logicke, Grammar, Rhetoricke, Naturall Philoſophie, and laſtly the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of Diuinity. Hence wee ſay the vſe of arts is generall, but we mean the vſe of the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of arts, for the precepts of art are not only diſtinct, but the <hi>praxis</hi> to, and the <hi>prattomenon</hi> alſo till wee come to the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of it: as we may ſee in a Shipwright, his rule of art is diſtinct, his <hi>motus</hi> is diſtinct, and his <hi>prattomenon</hi> is diſtinct, till you come to looke at the manifold vſe of his <hi>prattomenon.</hi> So firſt the ſhepheard hath his <hi>prattomenon,</hi> then the graſier he vſeth the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of the ſhepheard, the butcher vſeth

So the Taylor takes cloth made to his hand, and he vſeth it to this, or that end, to make ſuch, or ſuch a garment with it. There is alſo that <gap reason="foreign">

the Arts of them, namely, Logicke, Grammar, and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke be generall: and becauſe the other doe not <hi>concro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcere</hi> with the reſt, but onely in part, <hi>ergo</hi> they are more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, for though number, and magnitude may <hi>concreſcere</hi> with nature, but not with all other Arts, as Logicke, &amp;c. therefore they are not ſo generall. Now things are more generall, or ſpeciall in vſe, <hi>ergo</hi> the Art which ſtill runnes on with the thing muſt bee diſtributed accordingly, not that I here diſtribute Art into <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> for in that ſenſe they are all alike, yea the moſt ſpeciall Art is as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, as that which is moſt generall, therfore take heed of that, for I doe not meane ſo, but I meane that ſome Arts are more generall in reſpect of the generall vſe of their <hi>prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomenon,</hi> and ſome are more ſpeciall in regard of the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vſe of it, as one Art may be without another, and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is before it, as one is before two, for ſo Logick need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not any other Art, but all the reſt haue need of it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue heard what <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is, and of <hi>Ars,</hi> and that the ſubiect of it is <hi>Res,</hi> that hath an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Wee haue heard moreouer the affections of Arts, and the Species of them, that they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the thing acting, or ſpeciall of the thing acted. Now then the firſt thing in nature is reaſon, and here remember what wee heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we may ſee as God gouerned things in generall by arts: ſo in ſpeciall reaſon by Logicke; and it is moſt generall, becauſe it is of moſt generall vſe, not in regard of his Precepts, for ſo it is as ſpeciall as any, but for vſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be nothing without Logicke, yet Logicke may be without ſpeech, quantity, &amp;c. <hi>ergo,</hi> this is moſt generall. Now true it is, that this, as alſo the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the thing in nature; yet Logick is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall then any of the reſt in regard of his vſe, for it is in it ſelfe in ſpeech, in quantitie, &amp;c. ſo that looke where any art is, there Logicke is; but it doth not follow, that where Logick is, there Arithmetick, Geometry &amp;c. ſhould bee. Againe, it pleaſed the Lord to make man his Steward vnder him ouer all the Creatures, <hi>ergo,</hi> in this reſpect it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16408:18"/>
he ſhould behold all the creatures, to the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the vſe of the principall Lord, therefore hee muſt firſt ſee them, therefore muſt bee prepared with ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie that he may ſee all things by it. Now this is <hi>omnium</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That there is ſuch an art, I ſhew it thus.</p>
               <p>If there be reaſon, then there is an art of it, becauſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is <hi>ens a primo,</hi> and it is for an end, therefore there muſt be that art, that is of reaſons act. For the Propoſition I proued it before, for reaſon was for an end; for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption none will deny, but that there is reaſon, if they will acknowledge themſelues to be but men. Our author cal: this art <hi>Dialectica,</hi> which comes of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifying <hi>ſecerno, ſeparo, ſeligo;</hi> as for example, if there were many things together, I would ſeuere them, and this name fitteth reaſons act very well; for Logicke is like a fire among the Chimiſts, for as fire will <hi>congregare homogenia,</hi> and <hi>ſegregare heterogenia:</hi> ſo Logicke is the fire of all arts ſeuering in the ſame act, that fire doth, Logick from Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and Rhetorick from both, &amp;c. and then it congregates to Logick that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is <hi>congreans</hi> to it, to Grammar that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is <hi>homogenie</hi> to it, &amp;c. ſo that when it inuents, it picks out <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenies,</hi> it diſpoſeth them, and layes them in ſeuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, therefore this name <hi>Dialectica</hi> is very fitly giuen to this art, that workes this wonderfull effect. Wonderfull I may call it, for the Chimiſts can doe great effects, but the Logicians can doe greater, for they can ſee Gods Logicke in the things, and had not man falne, he might haue come to haue ſeene all the wiſedome of God in the Creatures. Now if Logick doth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>congregare homogenia,</hi> and <hi>ſegregare heterogenia</hi> by the ſame effect, it may fitly be ſo called: now this art is ſo called, ſaith <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> firſt by <hi>Plato,</hi> if hee were the author, hee was more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent then <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and antiquity ſhould haue honour with good reaſon, if we haue any reaſon: nay, Geometrie is ſo called from its ſubiect rather, not <hi>metiri</hi> from antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but <hi>Zenophon</hi> in his fourth booke of remembrances ſaith that <hi>Socrates</hi> was <hi>Platoes</hi> Schoolemaſter, and he neuer
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16408:18"/>
writ any thing, but <hi>Plato</hi> alwaies: ſo that <hi>Socrates</hi> might reade it, and <hi>Zenophon</hi> heare it, for he was his Scholler, for <hi>Zenophon &amp; Plato fuere aequales,</hi> and <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> might reade it in <hi>Plato,</hi> as hee had noted it from <hi>Socrates:</hi> and the Oracle witneſſeth that <hi>Socrates</hi> was the wiſeſt man in his time, and he was more wiſe then <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> for <hi>Plato</hi> that was <hi>Socrates</hi> Scholler, was his Maſter; ſo that for this name we ſee how fitly it agrees to this art, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the confirmation of it from antiquitie. Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals it Logicke, I doe not deny but the name is good, but it is later, as <hi>Laertius</hi> witneſſeth that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gaue it firſt, but it is from the ſubiect reaſon, as the names of moſt arts are. Arithmeticke of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>terra,</hi> &amp;c. but it doth not ſo liuely name this art, as <hi>Dialectica</hi> doth, which names the life, and deliuers the quinteſſence of Logick: ſo that <hi>Logica,</hi> as it is coniugare of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, names it well, but doth not ſet it out with that vigour that <hi>Dialectica</hi> doth: So thus wee ſee the reaſon of the name.</p>
               <q>Eſt ars.</q>
               <p>What art is we heard before, this it is, euery thing hath an <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which cauſes the precepts of art to be anſwerable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; ſo that Logicks maine end is <hi>bene diſſerere: bene inuenire,</hi> and <hi>bene iudicare</hi> are the pettie acts of it. Now if <hi>Logica,</hi> and <hi>Dialectica</hi> ſhew the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and frame of mans reaſon, and direct it to the chiefe end, its happineſſe, where the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, reſteth, then it is <hi>ars: at, ergo.</hi>

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:16408:19"/>Eſt ars bene diſſerendi.</q>
               <p>Firſt <hi>diſſerendi,</hi> for the explanation of the word, <hi>diſſero</hi> comes of <hi>diſ</hi> and <hi>ſero, ſero</hi> ſignifies firſt to ſow and <hi>diſ</hi> a ſunder, or <hi>diſſero,</hi> that makes <hi>diſſerui,</hi> to ſow aſunder; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo vſed I find not, I for my part euer read it in this Logicall ſignification, and that which I told you of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>dilectica,</hi> is true of this, that as there was things to be ſowne, and a <hi>ſatio ſecernendorum,</hi> and a ſowing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder: ſo there are firſt <hi>ſemina,</hi> which are arguments in inuention: Secondly, a <hi>ſatio</hi> of them, that is, a diſpoſing of them Axiomatically, and ſyllogiſtcally; and laſtly, a <hi>diſſetio,</hi> that is a diſpoſing of them according to true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and order; ſo that in this <hi>diſſerere</hi> we haue the nature of reaſon quite through, as we had in <hi>Dialectica.</hi> So that this name deliuers alſo to vs very fitly the very ſoule of Logicke; for as in mans body there is a ſoule or a forme <hi>per quam res eſt, id quod eſt, &amp; à caeteris rebus diſtinguitur;</hi> ſo there is of this art, or rather of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of it, reaſon: and as in other things the Lord hath wrought ſo cunningly that wee cannot ſee their forms, but onely the next acts to the formes: ſo here our author deſireth to giue to vs the forme of reaſon; which becauſe he cannot do, therfore he deliuers it by the finall cauſe, the next act to the forme: ſo that when he ſaith <hi>dialectica eſt ars bene diſſerendi,</hi> he meanes it is ſuch an art that hath ſuch a forme that doth <hi>bene diſſerere,</hi> therefore I conclude thus: If this be the happineſſe, the act, and foule of reaſon, then it is defined fitly <hi>Ars bene diſſerendi. at. ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Bene.</q>
               <p>Here it is an aduerbe, for Grammar here doth declare ſome controuerſie, and an aduerbe is a part of ſpeech ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the verbe to ſhew his ſignification, therefore <hi>bene</hi> is here added to make perfect the act of this <hi>diſſerere,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16408:19"/>
ergo, bene diſſerere</hi> is not two things, but one thing, &amp; this is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation in defining arts, to break the forms of them, as little as we can, becauſe the forme is but one argument; and if wee put two, or more words into the forme, wee breake it into ſo many peeces. Now for the reaſon of <hi>bene</hi> in a Art, this it is, Art is the rule of the frame of <hi>Ens à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo:</hi> ſo Logicke is the rule of reaſon, as it is Gods creature, <hi>ergo,</hi> as it is good, <hi>ergo, bene</hi> is here put in well to ſhew the Act of the goodneſſe of this reaſon. Now ſince the fall of man, his reaſon is weakned, and darkned, and ſo there is a <hi>bona ratio,</hi> and a <hi>mala ratio,</hi> though <hi>mala ratio</hi> is not <hi>ratio</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but the errour of <hi>ratio,</hi> and this act is to guide rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as it doth <hi>bene diſſerere,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>diſſerere, ergo,</hi> it is well put in to ſeuer them. For if <hi>Dialectica</hi> be <hi>ars rationis bene agentis,</hi> then it is <hi>ars bene diſſerendi</hi> onely, and not <hi>malè diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerendi, at, ergo.</hi> So Grammar is the Art onely <hi>bene loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> though it diſcrie <hi>malèe loqui:</hi> now here among the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians are many queſtions, and controuerſies againſt our Author. As ſome except againſt the name <hi>dialectica,</hi> and makes it more ſpeciall then here <hi>Ramus</hi> takes it, and they diſtribute reaſon into three parts, <hi>Dialectica, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtica,</hi> and <hi>Apodictica,</hi> which was the diſtribution of the Ariſtotelians, not of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe; but <hi>Simplicius</hi> that chiefe fellow, was the firſt man that brought it vp, and afterward it was generally receiued in Schooles from him. By <hi>Dialectica</hi> they vnderſtand al probable reaſon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bality in Schooles is taken in two ſignifications, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is taken for a contingent true axiome, <hi>ergo,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to one little particle of the doctrine of <hi>axioma.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken for <hi>axioma dubium,</hi> or <hi>quaeſtio,</hi> and then it belongs to the doctrine of Syllogiſmes; ſo that we ſhall find probabilitie in theſe two places; but to make <hi>Dialectica</hi> ſo ſpecial, is to make a Camel go through the eie of a needle; is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> no more generall then ſo? doth it not goe though all iudgement, yea and inuention too?</p>
               <p>Againe, for <hi>Apodictica,</hi> which is <hi>de neceſſarijs,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a neceſſary axiome, for no ſyllogiſmes are are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16408:20"/>
but the axiomes which they conſiſt of; but the ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſticall iudgement is the ſame both of neceſſary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent axiomes, and a ſyllogiſme of contingent propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is neceſſary as well as that, which is of neceſſary axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes. Now for <hi>Sophiſtica,</hi> that is ſhut out, for if I ſee the truth, what need I looke farther: and wheras they alleadge, that it is of the apparencie of truth, what care I for that? yet it is counterfeit: ſo that they would haue al Logick to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a neceſſary, and a contingent axiome, for no ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes are ſo: and that is the reaſon, that <hi>Ramus</hi> denies that demonſtration; for their neceſſary that they ſpeake of, is in axiom, not in ſyllogiſme. Againe <hi>Sophiſtica</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all arts, and not ſpeciall to Logick, for all arts haue their errors. Now the Schooles diſtribute Logicke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dialectica, Grammatica,</hi> and <hi>Rhetorica,</hi> which ſauours of a notorious equiuocation. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> indeed ſignifies <hi>ratio,</hi> and <hi>oratio,</hi> but this is onely a diſtributing of the name, not of the thing, as if they ſhould ſay <hi>Logica</hi> ſignifies <hi>ratio,</hi> or ſpeech: many alſo there are that finde fault with <hi>Ramus,</hi> for the reaſon of this name, ſome ſay it come of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>colloquor;</hi> but that is not becauſe of their <hi>collocutio,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their reaſoning in their ſpeech together: but again, what hath Logick to doe with words, and to name Logick from ſpeech hath no reaſon at all, for it may be without it. There is alſo a great queſtion, whether <hi>Dialectica</hi> be <hi>Ars,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> will haue it; becauſe ſaith hee <hi>opus poſt ſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit;</hi> or if it be <hi>facultas,</hi> as <hi>Craelius</hi> holds, or whether it bee <hi>ſcientia,</hi> as others ſay. Theſe are bables, we haue heard that the wiſedome of God is <hi>Ars</hi> in the thing, it is called <hi>ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> by a metonimy of the adiunct for the ſubiect, which is properly the iudgement of a rule of art: ſo that here is a double trope, firſt a metonimy of the adiunct for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, the knowledge of the art, for the art it ſelfe: then a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche of the part for the whole, the rule for the whole art, for <hi>facultas,</hi> that is the ſubiect <hi>ratio: ergo, Craelius</hi> ſpeaks by metonimy of the ſubiect for the adiunct; for the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is reaſon it ſelf; ſo that <hi>dialectica eſt ars:</hi> as for their diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16408:20"/>
in Schooles, that <hi>ars</hi> doth <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>contemplare,</hi> it is a bable, wee ſee <hi>ſcientia</hi> is the knowledge of the art, and <hi>ars</hi> is <hi>rei,</hi> as Arithmetick is of number, Geometrie of magnitude, &amp;c. and Logicke of reaſon, ſo that the <hi>ſcientia</hi> or Theorie of art is <hi>fallacia ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentis,</hi> to take it for the art it ſelfe, and is as if wee ſhould ſay, a painted man is a true man, <hi>ergo,</hi> when we ſay a man is a good Logician, we meane a man hath that knowledge of reaſon, and ſo for other arts; ſo that our knowledge of an art is no more of the eſſence of it, then my knowledge of a man is of the eſſence of the man. Againe, when I ſay the knowledge of an art, I ſay two things, knowledge, and art, which are ſubiect and adiunct <hi>ergo,</hi> knowledge is but accidentall to the art. For <hi>bene diſſerendi</hi> there are many aduerſaries, and one grand enemie, ſome ſay it is rather <hi>ars bene vtendi ratione,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is an adiunct to art, and it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> not <hi>artis,</hi> as for example, we cannot ſay, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, or Mariner vſeth the ſhipwrights art, but his work, but this is the chiefe abſurdity that it breaks the forme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to peeces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kickerman</hi> cries out againſt <hi>Ramus</hi> for this definition, and ſayes it is a trope, <hi>ergo,</hi> ought not to bee in art, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets his rules, for Rhetorick is a generall art, <hi>ergo,</hi> it may be euerie where, but ſaith he, is it not better to teach with proper words, then with tropicall, they are fit for ſimple men, not for iudicious; <hi>I</hi> will confeſſe it, and <hi>Ramus</hi> too, for Grammar is before Rhetoricke, <hi>ergo,</hi> ſhould be preferred: yet Tropes may bee as plaine, and as ſignificant as other words ſometimes; but I make no doubt, but that <hi>diſſerere</hi> is euer vſed in other ſenſe then this Logical ſignification: but if it bee, let him giue me a better word; but he cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not, but ſayes, <hi>logica eſt ars dirigendi mentem in cognitione rerum,</hi> and ſo breakes all in peeces. Againe, what doth <hi>dirigere</hi> here? It belongs to art in generall, for <hi>dirigere</hi> is as large as <hi>regere,</hi> and <hi>regere</hi> as <hi>regula,</hi> and <hi>regula</hi> as <hi>praeceptum;</hi> ſo that here he cannot bee content to horſe me vp to art in generall, for the <hi>genus</hi> onely, but for the

forme too. Againe for <hi>mens,</hi> he cannot abide Tropes; but what meanes he by <hi>mens?</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth properly the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine part of the ſoule of man, and ſometimes it is taken for the faculties of the ſoule, but here he muſt take it for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>ergo,</hi> here are two Tropes, firſt a metonimy of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect for the adiunct, the faculties for the ſoule it ſelfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a ſynecdoche of the part for the whole, reaſon for the ſoule. For <hi>cognitio</hi> it comes of <hi>con,</hi> and <hi>notio,</hi> to ſee things laid together, and it is the iudgement of an axiome, and belongs to it, which is but a little particle of Logick.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for <hi>res,</hi> that is as generall as <hi>ens,</hi> which is as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall as <hi>ars, ergo,</hi> thus he hoiſts me vp, and downe, firſt to <hi>ars</hi> in generall; then downe againe to naturall Philoſophy, for <hi>mens</hi> belongs thither, then to one peece of Logick: then againe vp to <hi>ars;</hi> and thus much for the explanation of the rule: the practiſe of it ſtands in this: God hath made all things for man, therefore he muſt haue an eye to ſee them, and all of them muſt be lyable to it, <hi>ergo,</hi> this rule tels vs, firſt, if we would looke at any thing we muſt take it with vs, for it is <hi>ars bene diſſerendi,</hi> and ſo we ſhall ſee it: ſo that if wee would doe anie thing with reaſon this puls vs by the eare and ſayes it is the art to reaſon well: ſo that here wee may ſee the commendation of this art, not onely in reſpect of the generall vſe of it, but in that it teacheth vs how to worke by it, as God hath done before vs: ſo that it firſt teacheth vs Gods will and pleaſure in things; and then what he would haue vs to doe in the managing and gouerning of them: and here we may ſee that all, things at the firſt were made for one man.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow we come to the ſecond rule, hauing heard that <hi>Dialecticae eſt ars bene diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendi;</hi> this rule needs nothing to make it plaine, but that which went before <hi>ſcilicet ars</hi> in general, to ſhew this to be an Art, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of euery <hi>ens à primo,</hi> to ſhew that this Arts end is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne diſſerere,</hi> both which we heard of in the doctrine of art, therefore this rule ſhewing what is pictured in this booke needs no more explanation, therefore it is the firſt rule of all, for it giues light to all the rules following, and takes light of none: therefore doth this ſecond rule giue light to the former? no, it rather obſcures it, for I muſt firſt know what <hi>Dialectica</hi> is before I heare it diuided, for how can I diuide I know not what? therefore this rule will giue no light to the firſt, therefore neuer a rule following, and the firſt rule is a comment to this. <hi>Dialectica,</hi> that is, that which was <hi>ars bene diſſerendi,</hi> hath two parts, <hi>bene inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire argumenta,</hi> and <hi>bene diſponere argumenta:</hi> why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are portions of this Art tending <hi>ad bene diſſeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di partes.</hi> Can <hi>Dialectica,</hi> this Art be parted? If it be that wiſedome of God that is one moſt ſimple being, how comes it to bee diuided into branches? I haue ſhewed howſoeuer it is one in God, yet hee hath made reaſon twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the thing, ſo that before it can <hi>bene diſſerere,</hi> it muſt <hi>bene inuenire,</hi> and <hi>bene iudicare:</hi> ſo that now reaſon as it is the ſubiect of Logicke, namely as it doth act, and is for an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and reaſon according to his frame hath theſe two operations, <hi>inuenire,</hi> and <hi>iudicare,</hi> therefore the Art being the Idea of this frame, that hath two parts, muſt haue two parts, for Logicke behold reaſon, not as it is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty belonging to naturall Philoſophie, but as it acts.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16408:23"/>
Now thus I argue. If reaſons frame runne into two heads, or actions, that it may <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then the Art muſt do ſo, now that reaſon is framed to runne into theſe two heads, thus I ſhewed it, All things were made for man, therefore he muſt haue an eye to ſee them: now all things that God hath made are conſidered in themſelues, or with others, for the world is one conſiſting of many parts, and they are conſidered alone or with others, therefore mans reaſon muſt runne accordingly. God onely is entire in himſelfe hauing no reſpect to any other thing, he is ſimple, and hath no parts, therefore he is not lyable to Logicke: all other things are compoſed, that it might appeare, that he is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo that euery thing elſe is compoſed, or diſpoſed with others, yet firſt it muſt bee in it ſelfe, in vſe: for if I ſay a bricke-wall, there muſt needs firſt be bricks, and what vſe haue we of words alone in Grammar, but in Syntax, and firſt we muſt ſee the Etimologie of them: nay in euery art except Rhetoricke there is no vſe of the firſt part without the ſecond, neither is inuention euer without iudgement, therefore when euery thing hath his double conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there muſt be two parts of reaſon, for as things are, ſo muſt reaſons act be, for euery thing muſt be ſo adminiſtred as that it be lyable to reaſon, and bee conſidered alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be diſpoſed: therefore inuention is firſt, ſo that any man that hath reaſon will acknowledge the neceſſity of this diſtribution: now theſe two parts are called Inuention and Diſpoſition. Firſt for the reaſon of the name Inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, man was to ſee all Gods creatures, and ſo to ſee his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in them: now how ſhould man ſee them? were they written in his vnderſtanding? no more then <hi>Pauls</hi> ſteeple is in my eye, for man came furniſhed into the world onely with Logicke, Grammar, Rhetoricke and Diuinity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the knowledge of theſe Arts, but with the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of them, and therefore the Arts muſt needes be there, for we reade the Arts in the things: ſo that for Arithmetick Geometry, and nature, man was to learne them by the creatures, as he was alſo to learn the knowledge of Logick,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16408:23"/>
Grammar, Rhetoricke, and Diuinity. The reaſon is this, the <hi>Geneſis</hi> of euery thing is Gods, and man muſt ſee the rules of Art, therefore man muſt ſee them from ſingulars, by <hi>analyſis:</hi> now then if man muſt learne theſe, and know them by his ſenſes obſeruation, induction, and experience, then he muſt ſeeke, and finde out theſe, for they are not written in him: againe, whereas euery thing is in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it is requiſite that man finde them out, and ſee them ſeuerally, therefore in this reſpect is this art of reaſon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely as he is ſent by God to find out theſe things in his creatures; now if man muſt finde them out with this act of his eye of reaſon, then is it fitly called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, <hi>at, ergo.</hi> And this teacheth man thus much, that he is to ſeeke out, and finde this wiſedome of God in the world, and not to be idle; for the world, and the creatures therein are like a booke wherein Gods wiſedome is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and there muſt wee ſeeke it out. Why is not this firſt Art called Diſpoſition, becauſe that is more familiar, and eaſie to vs, for all things are diſpoſed; but we are by this Art to ſeuer them, and to looke at them ſimply, ſo that this name teacheth man what he is to doe in this act of his reaſon, namely, <hi>inuenire argumenta,</hi> as in miſts to looke at the elements, &amp;c. Now <hi>Kickerman</hi> cannot away with this diſtribution, and yet ſayes nothing to this purpoſe againſt it, for I ſuppoſe Inuention to be an ambiguous name, and haue equiuocation with it, as I do not deny, but it is taken ſometimes for iudgement, but that is tropically, yet while my author tells me what it is, that is ſufficient to know his meaning how here it is taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But Inuention is neuer without iudgment ſaith he, no inuentions vſe is euer without iudgements vſe: ſo hee may ſay Etimologie is neuer without Syntax. I, but ſaith he, you cannot inuent without iudgement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are no parts of Logicke? as for example, a cheſt is made of wood, by this rule <hi>materia eſt cauſa ex qua res eſt,</hi> therefore here is ſyllogiſticall iudgement, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>à definitione,</hi> and this is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> demonſtration,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16408:24"/>
as if you ſhould make a ſyllogiſme thus, That whereof the thing is, that is <hi>materia,</hi> But wood is that <hi>ex quo</hi> the Cheſt is, <hi>ergo.</hi> But here is onely Logicks practiſe, and not any rule of Art taught vs. The queſtion betwixt <hi>Ramus</hi> and him is, whether any rule of inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belongs to iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This it is, the rules of inuention giue precepts of nothing at all concerning iudgement, <hi>aut contra:</hi> therefore theſe are the true parts of Logicke: and whilſt hee argues from the precept to the rule, it is <hi>fallacia accidentis,</hi> as if he ſhould reaſon: <hi>Socrates eſt animal, animal eſt genus, ergo Socrates eſt genus;</hi> whereas we know the thing <hi>animal</hi> is not that Logicall notion, neither <hi>Socrates,</hi> for they belong to naturall Philoſophy, but <hi>genus</hi> is no adiunct attributed vnto them, ſo this inuention is onely of ſimple arguments, and of the ſimple conſideration of them, and therefore our Art runnes along according to Gods order, and though we cannot practice any rule of inuention, but by iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it doth not therefore follow that they are the ſame, for it is as if he ſhould ſay this, <hi>homo, quae pars orationis? Nomen,</hi> here is the practice of Syntax, <hi>ergo</hi> Etimologie, and Syntax, are all one.</p>
               <q>Inuentio eſt prima pars Dialecticae de inueniendis argumentis.</q>
               <p>Wee haue heard of the reaſon of the name Inuention, why it is giuen to the firſt part, and that with great reaſon, for wee muſt finde by much ſeeking before wee can ſee things. Againe, Logicke being the firſt helpe to ſee Gods wiſedome in his creatures, and this vſe of inuention being to be found in the thing, it is hard to finde, therefore it is fitly called inuention from the act of it: ſo againe in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, a man is ſame to ſeeke a third argument to proue his queſtion. Iudgement the ſecond part is properly the act of our vnderſtanding, when it lookes at arguments diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, therefore here it is a metonimie of the adiunct for the ſubiect, when it is put for <hi>diſpoſitio:</hi> and againe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16408:24"/>
the diſpoſing of arguments together, which is of Axiomes and Syllogiſmes.</p>
               <p>Method doth not looke at the diſpoſing of arguments, but at the placing of axiomes: ſo that if I would diſtribute <hi>Dilectica</hi> thus, <hi>Dalecticae partes duae ſunt, inuentio, &amp; diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio: diſpoſitio</hi> is <hi>iudicium,</hi> or <hi>Methodus, iudicium eſt axiomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> or <hi>ſyllogiſticum:</hi> my reaſons are theſe: the arts of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are performed by the internall ſenſes, the beſt phanſie inuents beſt, and that is performed by a hot braine: cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſerues iudgement axiomaticall, and ſyllogiſticall, and that is drie, and the beſt memorie is an ayrie moyſt brain: <hi>ergo,</hi> whilſt I ſee from this reaſon in naturall Philoſophy, that axiomaticall and ſyllogiſticall iudgement are thus combined, and the other ſeuered, I thinke this art ſhould be thus diuided according to their inſtruments, as nature hath ſeuered them. Againe, our Author diſtributeth the ſecond part into <hi>axioma,</hi> and <hi>diſcurſus,</hi> and vnder <hi>diſcurſus</hi> he placeth <hi>ſyllogiſmus</hi> and <hi>Methodus:</hi> now theſe two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ioyned together: for why? what hath method to doe with <hi>ſyllogiſmus?</hi> Method doth not diſpoſe ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes, but axiomes. Againe the vſe of a ſyllogiſme is to make cleare that that is obſcure, and to manifeſt truth; and the rule of truth belongs to axiomaticall iudgment if it be cleare; if not, then to ſyllogſticall iudgement: but wee bring our queſtion after againe to an axiome to ſee the truth of it, <hi>ergo,</hi> theſe two worke about one thing, namely about truth, therefore they ſhould be combined together. So that ſyllogiſticall iudgement is to make cleare that, which axiomaticall iudgement could not, yet the doctrine of <hi>axioma</hi> is before, and ſyllogiſtical iudgment hath for his ſubiect <hi>axioma dubium.</hi> The exceptions againſt this rule are theſe: firſt, <hi>Kickerman</hi> ſaith, There is no inuention, but there is iudgement withall, that is confeſſed to be true in vſe, as in Grammar the vſe of Etimologie is neuer without Syntax, but the vſe is one thing, and the rule another: there is no precept of inuention, that belongs to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>aut contra:</hi> then he ſaith, Who can inuent, but hee
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16408:25"/>
muſt alſo iudge? for (ſaith hee) muſt not a man iudge a cauſe before he finde it? this is alſo a fallace of vſe: wee cannot finde a rule, but wee vſe both inuention and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by his argument, there ſhould be no iudgment, but ſyllogiſticall: then againe he ſaith, inuention was vſed for a third argument, and not as <hi>Ramus</hi> taketh it.</p>
               <p>True it is, the Schooles thought it onely to belongs to ſyllogiſmes, &amp; that there was but the vſe of an argument, not the doctrine of it, but thus I argue: Is inuention of a third argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is of an argument, <hi>ergo</hi> then it belongs not to iudgement: for the doctrine of a ſimple conceit, as he calles it, is diſtinct from the doctrine of iudgement. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if it bee a third Argument, there was two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ergo,</hi> there are Arguments diſpoſed. Againe, when a third Argument is found out, doe wee not diſpoſe <hi>pars conſequens quaeſtionis in propoſitione,</hi> and <hi>antecedens in aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,;</hi> and ſo make the propoſition an axiome, and likewiſe the aſſumption: <hi>ergo,</hi> an argument is placed in an axiom as well as in a ſyllogiſme by their owne confeſſion: therefore we ſee euidently here, that the vſe of an Argument is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to ſyllogiſticall and axiomaticall iudgement. And I would aske, whether <hi>cauſa eſt cuius vi res eſt,</hi> when it is diſpoſed with the effect, be the ſame, and haue the ſame definition in an axiome, that it hath in a ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme? If they ſay it is the ſame, <hi>ergo,</hi> common to both, <hi>ergo,</hi> the doctrine of <hi>cauſa,</hi> and <hi>effectum, &amp;c.</hi> muſt goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doctrine of an axiome, and a ſyllogiſme, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and muſt be diſtinct from them all: for as method is diſtinct from axiomaticall, and ſyllogiſticall iudgement, and is before them, becauſe an axiome may bee without them, not <hi>contra:</hi> So is the doctrine of Arguments before the doctrine of axiomes for the ſame reaſon: and <hi>Kicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> confeſſeth as much, whilſt he diſtributes Logicke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>terminus ſimplex, complexus,</hi> and <hi>diſcurſus:</hi> he ſaith Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of arts are called inuentors, as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> of <hi>Medicina, Ariſtotle</hi> of Logicke, but did they not all iudge them? yes, but doth it therefore follow, that inuention and iudgment
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16408:25"/>
are not diuers things, ſo that this diſtribution ſtands firme, and ſure, and as for his conceit to haue inuention taught in a ſyllogiſme, we ſhall heare of it when wee come there, for it is very ſeely. Now for his diſtribution into three parts, it comes to one with ours, for his firſt part <hi>terminus ſimplex,</hi> ſo much of it as is Logicke belongs to inuention, ſo <hi>terminus complexus</hi> belongs to axiomaticall iudgement, and <hi>diſcurſus</hi> to ſyllogiſmes, and he would haue it belong to method too. But firſt that abſurdities are theſe, he does not follow reaſons <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which Logicke deliuers, for <hi>conceptus ſimplex</hi> is properly the iudgement of a thing, when we ſee the truth thereof: ſo that this is not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as inuention. Now when I ſay <hi>inuentio,</hi> I ſay that part that directs my reaſon to ſeeke out things ſecretly wrapt vp in nature, againe whileſt hee makes a diſtribution of the precepts of Logicke, by theſe precepts we muſt vnderſtand the ſyſtema of Logicke by a Metonimie of the materiall cauſe, and when he ſaies a ſyſtema of precepts, that is a far fetched trope: againe wee neuer haue more parts then two in a diſtribution, but there is ſome thing left out, for to admit of his diſtribution: but is there not a community betwixt his <hi>terminus complexus,</hi> and <hi>diſcurſus,</hi> namely <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio? ergo,</hi> here he wants the rule of <hi>diſpoſitio,</hi> and ſo makes his Art imperfect. Now he pleads for the antiquitie of it, which we are not to admit of, but of truth: why? his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke was not in ancient time, is it therefore nought now?</p>
               <p>The vſe of this rule is this, as we heard before, Logicke tooke my reaſon, and told me the markes to ſhoot at, ſo here it tells me that I muſt firſt inuent, and ſo I ſhall go or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to worke, and then diſpoſe, for the Brick-layer muſt firſt haue brickes before hee can make a bricke-wall, and the Grammarian muſt haue words before hee can make a ſentence, and (as before) arguments are more generall then axiomes, axiomes then ſyllogiſmes, &amp;c. for the one may be without the other, not <hi>contra,</hi> as one is more generall then two, two then three, &amp;c. becauſe one may be without two, or three, &amp;c. not <hi>contra:</hi> ſo firſt we muſt <hi>inuenire,</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16408:26"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>iudicare,</hi> that we may <hi>bene diſſerere,</hi> for there is nothing betwixt them, but when wee haue ſtones then wee may build, and whilſt we finde in the creatures of God things conſidered, as they are in themſelues, and then in reſpect of others, therefore ſo muſt reaſon be diſtributed into his two acts, and now we come to inuention which is <hi>prima pars Dialecticae de inueniendis argumentis,</hi> firſt we haue heard the reaſon of the name <hi>inuentio</hi> betokening actiuely: the reaſon inuenting or finding out, and howſoeuer wee may finde it taken for the whole act of Logicke, yet it is a Synecdoche, and though wee cannot but vſe iudgement in it, yet it is but <hi>inuentio, ergo, eſt pars.</hi> Hee rather keepes this word, then <hi>membrum,</hi> though it be more generall, becauſe it is more in vſe: and againe becauſe in Schooles <hi>membrum</hi> hath been vſually taken for the members of a man, as head, armes, legges, or the like: ſo that not hauing told vs what <hi>membrum,</hi> or <hi>pars</hi> is, he chooſeth the more vſuall <hi>Dialecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi> we heard concerning <hi>Dialectica</hi> before, therefore to heare it againe were ſuperfluous, it is <hi>Dialecticae, ergo,</hi> it is the <hi>integrum</hi> to it, as <hi>inuentio</hi> is the <hi>membru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Now indeed the Rhetoricians haue taken inuention to bee a part of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, and ſo iudgement, but when they come to explaine them, they teach Logicke: and their <hi>diſertus</hi> is not onely the Rhetorician, but the Grammarian, and Logician, their Orator is <hi>omnium horarum homo,</hi> a man for euery turne, ſo that he is a man in whom there is a confuſion of all Arts: neither is Orator belonging to Rhetoricke, but he is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall man, that hath all the Arts; and chiefly he is a Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: now the Rhetoricians did imagine, becauſe they vſed inuention, and iudgement, therefore they belonged to Rhetoricke: ſo they might ſay of Law, Arithmeticke, Geometry, naturall Philoſophy, or any other Art: now then thoſe are the two parts of <hi>Dialectica</hi> onely; and whereas men ſay commonly <hi>Ramus</hi> Logicke ſerues for Rhetoricke, not for naturall Philoſophy, as ſome doe, they ſpeake ſimply, for what vſe of Logicke hath a Rhetorician in any other Art, as in Politickes, is it not to proue ſome
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16408:26"/>
Theſis? therefore if he diſpute here as a Politician by the rule of Logicke, ſo may a naturall Philoſopher doe, ſo <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, effectum, ſubiectum, adiunctum,</hi> and all other arguments are the ſame in all Arts, <hi>ergo,</hi> to make a ſpeciall inuention to Rhetoricke, and another to nature, or any other Art, is ſimple. Now it is <hi>pars Dialecticae,</hi> wee doe not meane to make <hi>pars</hi> a <hi>genus</hi> of inuention here, for it is a Logical noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and belongs to Logicke: but the reaſon of this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to bring in <hi>Dialectica,</hi> ſo that when we will analyſe this definition, we muſt not ſay <hi>pars</hi> is <hi>genus,</hi> but <hi>Dialectica eſt integrum.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Kickerman</hi> ſaith <hi>vox</hi> is the ſubiect of this firſt part, and he hath many diſtinctions of it, as it is <hi>abſtracta,</hi> or <hi>concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> this is nothing but a diſtribution of <hi>nomen</hi> into <hi>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuum,</hi> and <hi>adiectiuum, quatenus voces,</hi> and therefore the old Grammarians did ſo teach it: if they looke at the thing they belong to coniugates in Logicke, and there wee ſhall ſee them to ſignifie the ſame thing; one abſolutely, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it hath reſpect to another, and they are there, not <hi>quatenus</hi> they are words, nor <hi>quatenus</hi> they ſignifie, if wee goe no farther, but <hi>quatenus</hi> they containe, ſymbolize the nature of firſt arguments. Againe, hee ſaith <hi>vox</hi> is <hi>vniuoca,</hi> or <hi>aequiuoca:</hi> alas there is <hi>vox vniuoca</hi> in the world, as <hi>homo</hi> his example is <hi>vox aequiuoca:</hi> if we call a painted man a man, as we may call tropically, but this belongs to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution, and is but an example thereof, not a rule: as <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> is <hi>ſidus,</hi> or <hi>animal terreſtre,</hi> or <hi>marinum,</hi> is a diſtribution, <hi>ex adiunctis:</hi> ſo that to make a precept of an example is great confuſion: and the definition of a thing will take away the ambiguitie of the word. More diſtinctions hee hath, which all are nothing, but ſeuerall ſorts of aequiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if hee ſhould ſay, there may bee aequiuocation of Grammar, and there may be aequiuocation in Rhetoricke, &amp;c. he tels vs further that a word muſt be <hi>certa, abſoluta, &amp;c.</hi> what hath Logicke to doe with this? let Grammar looke to that, for it breakes the definition of <hi>vox eſt nota qua, &amp;c.</hi> if it name not the thing fitly; as if <hi>vox</hi> ſhould ſay <hi>vox eſt vota qua vnumquodque vocatur;</hi> will you call a man a ſpade, then he bring in predicament, and praedicables. The world of Logicians doth imagine, that <hi>Architas Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentinus</hi> was the firſt inuenter of them, and taught them to his Scholler <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> now the reaſon that brought them in was this, that they might bee furniſhed with matter to

               <p>
                  <hi>Kickerman</hi> approues that purpoſe of them, for ſaith he, things doe not belong to Logicke, now the Logicke in a predicament is this, the order of things being placed one before another, and ſo hee ſaith the predicaments are of great vſe, for the finding of ſimples: Secondly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for <hi>terminus complexus,</hi> becauſe we ſee what may be a ſubiect, and a predicate in a propoſition: then another vſe of them (he ſayes) is for <hi>diſcurſus,</hi> for when we know what is aboue, and below, we may quickly know what is in the middeſt; and they are alſo of vſe for method.</p>
               <p>For the firſt Inuention of them, they are not ſtorehouſes, for there is nothing but hath an <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16408:29"/>
becauſe <hi>ſubſtantia</hi> is <hi>corporea,</hi> or <hi>incorporea,</hi> here is a diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution as a <hi>genus</hi> into his <hi>ſpecies:</hi> therefore, ſaith he, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Logick: ſo let him bring in the daubers Art too; for Logicks vſe is there. Thus doe they make a confuſion, not ſeeing things diſtinct. Againe, whereas they helpe to finde out a ſubiect, and predicate, they haue ſhut out ſome, namely <hi>incompleta,</hi> as a mans hand, which may be a ſubiect or a predicate, and when I ſay the world is made of the firſt matter, is not the firſt matter here a predicate? ſo they ſhut out <hi>tranſcendentia,</hi> as <hi>ens:</hi> but is not <hi>homo ens,</hi> therefore a predicate? Againe, is not a predicate an argument, <hi>ergo, artificiale, aut inartificiale?</hi> if <hi>artificiale,</hi> then fetched out of ſome Art, therfore let me cary my ſubiect to the Art wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it belongs; and there will I find any predicate: againe for the helpe of a <hi>medium,</hi> is euery <hi>medium</hi> a <hi>genus ſubalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num?</hi> Suppoſe we ſhall fetch a <hi>medium,</hi> that is, <hi>genus ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> or an <hi>indiuiduum,</hi> but let me goe to the Art of my ſubiect, and if I will take that which is aboue it, or below it, there I ſhall haue it done to my hand. Againe, he ſayes the doctrine of the predicaments ſerue for definitions, and differences, &amp;c. Why let mee goe to the Art, and there I ſhall ſee euery thing taught to my hand, ſo that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of predicaments <hi>quatenus</hi> they are adumbrations of the Arts, are to be ſeene in their Arts. But to reaſon, that becauſe Logickes vſe is there, therefore they belong to Logicke, is very abſurd. Againe, if there be this predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſhew the <hi>ſummum</hi> and <hi>ſubalternum genus,</hi> and <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſubalterna,</hi> and <hi>infima,</hi> why is there not a predicament to know <hi>cauſa?</hi> for by the ſame reaſon, there ſhould bee a predicament to find out <hi>cauſas,</hi> and let them ſay what they can of the predicaments, we ſhall finde all in the doctrine of diſtribution, and definition, as <hi>ſubſtantia</hi> is <hi>corporea, aut incorporea</hi> is a diſtribution, and belongs to naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and ſo the next diſtribution of <hi>ſubſtantia corporea, &amp;c.</hi> ſo if we take quantity, we ſhall ſee we are in ſome ſpeciall Arithmetick, or Geometry, &amp;c. for the predicables, <hi>genus, ſpecies, differentia, proprium, accidens,</hi> theſe wee know are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16408:30"/>
ſpeciall arguments, the two firſt belong to <hi>diſtributio ex effectis: differentia</hi> belongs to <hi>forma,</hi> for it is called <hi>forma,</hi> in reſpect of the thing formed; and <hi>differentia,</hi> as it diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the thing from all other things. If they ſhall ſay, I, but here is <hi>diſtributio per formam,</hi> that is accidentall to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and belongs to <hi>diſtributio,</hi> ſo that <hi>forma</hi> is the better word taken from the nature of it, for <hi>proprium</hi> is nothing but <hi>proprium adiunctum,</hi> and there it is taught as it hath reſpect to his ſubiect, not as it is an act, and <hi>accidens</hi> is alſo a ſpeciall kind of adiunct.</p>
               <p>Now the lawes of Art require, that euery precept deliuer the <hi>principia</hi> thereof, and therefore bee either defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, diſtributions, or properties, which they after a ſort ſeeing, made theſe to be helpes to the predicaments; now for <hi>ſubſtantia quoad res</hi> it belongs to naturall Philoſophy, <hi>quoad ſeriem</hi> or <hi>ordinem</hi> to method: for quantity it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Mathematickes: quality to morall Philoſophie, yea, and to naturall too: for relates, they belong to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke; but there can be no <hi>ſeries</hi> or order of them, for they are but examples of relates, as <hi>cauſa,</hi> and <hi>effectum</hi> are relates; but onely examples, <hi>ergo, infimae ſpecies:</hi> for <hi>actio</hi> it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>motus; quando</hi> is nothing but the adiunct of time, <hi>paſsio</hi> a ſubiect, <hi>vbi</hi> a ſpeciall kinde of ſubiect alſo of place, <hi>fitus</hi> belongs to Geometry, otherwiſe it is an adiunct, and <hi>habitus</hi> is a ſpeciall kinde of adiunct, therefore there can be nothing beneath theſe, but examples: ſo that doe but look at his table, and you ſhall ſee him preſently goe out, as hee ſayes <hi>qualitas</hi> is <hi>naturalis,</hi> and <hi>moralis:</hi> this is falſe, for <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis, aut moralis</hi> are two examples of that adiunct <hi>qualitas,</hi> and iuſtice is no more a quality becauſe it is a vertue, then <hi>Socrates eſt genus,</hi> becauſe <hi>animal</hi> is <hi>genus:</hi> ſo that <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> is the true ſubiect of Inuention, and not the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cables, and predicaments, any further then they are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

arguendum.</hi> Why <hi>ad arguendum?</hi> becauſe the end of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is to argue, to play the argument, as the eye to ſee: <hi>ad arguendum,</hi> becauſe euermore when wee fetch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſhew any thing that is the <hi>arguens,</hi> and doth <hi>age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> the <hi>aliquid</hi> is alſo an argument, but it doth <hi>pati:</hi> ſo that as <hi>quod</hi> was generall, that is <hi>arguens,</hi> or does argue, ſo it tells mee that any thing may bee argued: ſo <hi>homo eſt aliquid,</hi> here <hi>homo</hi> is the <hi>aliquid,</hi> and is argued by his <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which chargeth <hi>homo,</hi> therefore there is nothing in the world, but is an argument, and may argue, or bee argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but remember that both <hi>quod,</hi> &amp; the <hi>aliquid,</hi> that is both the <hi>arguens,</hi> and <hi>argutum</hi> doe <hi>arguere,</hi> but the one firſtly, the other ſecondly; the one doth <hi>agere,</hi> the other doth <hi>pati,</hi> and ſo <hi>reagere.</hi> The <hi>aliquid</hi> tells me it is the firſt, &amp; then <hi>quod</hi> comes, and argues it: now would you argue, then euermore looke firſt, and that carefully, whether your <hi>quod</hi> will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue your <hi>aliquid:</hi> as will you build an houſe with ſand? that will not ſerue the turne, for it is not <hi>affectum</hi> to it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it that <gap reason="foreign">

As the Cuckow cries Cuckowe, the Cuckow is Cuckow, <hi>ergo</hi> the Cuckow cries Cuckow, for here is no third argument; and this is commonly the womans reaſon, becauſe it hath ſo little reaſon in it, as they will ſay it is ſo, becauſe it is ſo. So that <hi>ſimplex conuerſio</hi> among Logicians is a breach of this rule: as <hi>omnis homo eſt animal, ergo, aliquod animal eſt homo:</hi> other Logicians as <hi>Polanus,</hi> cals <hi>argumentum The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> which is too ſpeciall, for <hi>thema</hi> is taken among ſchooles for a queſtion to be iudged by way of oration: againe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery argument is not taken as <hi>thema,</hi> then he ſays <hi>thema eſt ſimplex,</hi> which is <hi>argumentum,</hi> or <hi>compoſitum,</hi> which is <hi>quaeſtio;</hi> and thus we ſee how our Logicke goes moſt order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that it lookes at <hi>ens</hi> as it is ſimmonted with another thing.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16408:32"/>
one as an artificiall argument, the other as an inartificiall: now the reaſon of this diſtribution is this:</p>
               <p>God hath made all things for man, and at the beginning for one man, and they are to conduce to one, but all things cannot come vnder one mans eye of reaſon: therefore that he may be better furniſhed herein, God hath prouided theſe two; the one whereby he may ſee by himſelfe, the other whereby he may ſee by another mans eye. Againe, that which we are to ſee is either <hi>in artificio rei,</hi> or not <hi>in artificio rei:</hi> ſo that all things are ſeeable, but not to be ſeen with one mans eye, but by many. This word <hi>artificiale</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs theſe things: firſt there is no artificiall argument, but you ſhall ſee it <hi>in fabricarei,</hi> therefore belongs to ſome Art, becauſe Art deliuers the frame of the thing, therefore there is no axiom that conſiſteth of artificiall arguments, but it belongs to ſome Art. Now though we heare no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in Arts, but the cauſes, and properties, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we haue all arguments indeed; for there is no quality, but is <hi>proton</hi> in ſome generall thing, as heat in fire, cold in water: now this giues vs great light, yet ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects muſt be there if they be proper: and the effect belongs to that rule where the property is taught, and diſſentanies belong to art too; as nature is <hi>conſtans,</hi> or <hi>inconſtans, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum eſt artificiale, aut inartificiale:</hi> ſo that there are no axioms affirmed, or denyed, true, or falſe, but we ſhall find them in ſome Art, either as a firſt rule, or a deduct by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence neceſſary: ſo that hence is the greateſt light that can be to a Scholler, to analyſe all his example, and bring euery thing to his Art, where he ſhall ſee it <hi>in cauſa:</hi> ſo that if one would make a common place booke, let him make the Rules of Arts his heads, and let him take any example, and ſee whether argument is more ſpeciall, and ſo cary the axiom to that Art, and to that rule of the art whither it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. As <hi>homo eſt iuſtus, homo</hi> belongs to nature, <hi>iuſtitia</hi> to morall Philoſophy, <hi>ergo,</hi> this axiom belongs to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of iuſtice: ſo that morall Philoſophy borrowes man from nature to deliuer it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:16408:33"/>The vſe of this is vnſpeakable, I cannot deliuer it vnto you, the vſe it ſelfe will better teſtifie it; for thus may a man try euery thing whatſoeuer, yea though it be a contingent axiom; as <hi>audentes fortuna iuuat: audacia</hi> belongs to Ethicks, <hi>fortuna</hi> to Logicke; and in <hi>audacia</hi> we ſhall finde this, for it is that which thruſteth a man deſperately: and here we may ſee what a true predicament is, not the predicaments but the arts are the ſtorehouſes; for whatſoeuer is in <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio rei,</hi> we may ſee there, not onely <hi>genus, ſpecies, &amp;c.</hi> but all other argument, for they are too narrow and falſe too; for that diſtribution, <hi>ſubſtantia eſt creata,</hi> or <hi>increata,</hi> will not faile in any art, and the three firſt predicaments (as we heard before) are nothing but practices of method. Now if it be obiected, we muſt not haue thoſe things before we ſee them: no, we muſt firſt ſee them, that we may lay them vp in ſtore.

               <p>Now here is that affection, that is in this kinde of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that glue that was before, is here <hi>quod ex ſe:</hi> ſo that this makes that more ſpeciall, which before was more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: ſo that we ſhall ſtill ſee what our eye of reaſon ſees: we heard before that we ſee the thing, as it is an argument; here we ſee it, as it is affectioned to argue <hi>ex ſe. Ex ſe,</hi> what is that? as if he ſhould ſay, looke into the <hi>artificium</hi> of the thing, there ſhall you ſee his artificiall arguing, <hi>ex ſe,</hi> that is it argues <hi>natura,</hi> or it is <hi>cauſa natura</hi> of its arguing: ſo that theſe arguments concurre for the being of the thing. So wood is affected to argue a cheſt <hi>ex ſe,</hi> that is, it is in the <hi>artificio</hi> of wood to argue a cheſt made of wood <hi>ex ſe:</hi> ſo then this artificiall argument ariſeth from nature, from a <hi>vis ingenita,</hi> that is, <hi>in artificio rei:</hi> ſo the efficient argues <hi>ex ſe,</hi> as if I ſhould ſay, if there were not that cunning in the efficient of a cheſt to make it, it would not be one.

was the next <hi>genus,</hi> and he doth not expreſſe it, but vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it here, becauſe we heard of it ſo lately before: then againe he hath it here, but after another manner, becauſe he could not deliuer the forme of it, without the <hi>genus:</hi> for <hi>arguit</hi> is not here taken for act, but for <hi>potentia:</hi> as wee ſay <hi>animal vidit,</hi> though he doth not actually ſee, but haue the faculty of it: ſo we ſay, Does he eate or drinke? mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, can he eate or drinke. For if it were taken for the act of arguing, then it ſhould not be no where but in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo that <hi>quod arguit,</hi> is as much as <hi>argumentum,</hi> and <hi>ex ſe</hi> is the forme: if he had ſaid <hi>artificiale eſt argumentum ex ſeſe,</hi> he had ſaid the ſame that <hi>ex ſeſe arguit:</hi> but it had not beene ſo plaine to a young Scholler, and he had alſo new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done with <hi>argumentum</hi> before: ſo that this is the ſecond thing that our eye of reaſon is to looke at, namely, an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall argument, which can <hi>ex ſeſe arguere.</hi> Now <hi>fallaces</hi> may be in euery rule. In the firſt, as if any abuſe it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and abuſe reaſon: for the ſecond, if any goe about to iudge before he ſee the inuention, it is a fallace, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous courſe. So <hi>argumentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> is <hi>artificiale,</hi> or <hi>inartificiale;</hi> they breake this rule that will giue teſtimony of a thing, whoſe artificiall arguments they haue not ſeene: ſo do the Papiſts in their implicite faith, when they beleeue as the Church beleeues, not knowing what the Church belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. So ſchollers that take any thing that their authors deliuer them, without any examination at all of the things they reade. <hi>Kickerman</hi> ſaith, an inartificiall argument may be receiued before an artificiall. I doe not deny it, but yet you muſt examine it afterward: Gods teſtimonies onely are vndenyable, becauſe he cannot lye; but no mans.</p>

               <p>We are farther to looke at this glue, whereby a thing is put to another thing in <hi>artificio rei,</hi> it is there firſtly, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly: this affection or going to the act is there at the firſt hand, or at the ſecond hand: now it is the ſame ſtill,

but is looked at, as it is originally, or as it is ariſing from the firſt: as to make vp me, there goes a ſoule and a body, and of the formes of the foure elements is the forme of my body made, and of their matter the matter of my bodie made: now the elements are firſtly there, as making my body, and ſecondly my body is in me, as a part in me: ſo a man is firſt conſiſting of body and ſoule, and then is animall: now this wiſedome of God is wonderfull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how he makes things firſt of cauſes, effects, &amp;c, and then ranketh them vnder a generall head. And if we goe to the Creation, we ſhall ſee them euidently: firſt he made a firſt matter, then the firſt formes, and then miſts that had their complements, and did differ one from another, then they might be compared together, then they had names, and were ranked vnder generall heads, as a part to a whole, &amp;c. and then they might be defined, and their limits ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how farre they reach; for here our Author leads vs to ſee euery thing there, and to ſee how it is there, the reaſon of this diſtribution we ſhall ſee in euery thing whatſoeuer: as in an inke-horne, there muſt be the matter of it, then it ſelfe, and it muſt haue his adiuncts, &amp;c. and then will it hold your inke; then when it is this, it is not a tree, or a ſtone, though it may be compared, and be equall, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, like, or vnlike: ſo that firſt we ſee what is in it firſtly, then we may call it round, deepe, made of horne, then range it vnder a head, then lay it out in it limits, and then giue teſtimony of it.</p>
               <q>Primum quod eſt ſuae originis.</q>
               <p>This definition doth ſomewhat ſtick in my teeth before it come out, for it is a far fetched trope, and onely one is <hi>ſuae originis,</hi> namely God: but he meanes this clammineſſe or glue that is <hi>ſuae originis,</hi> is firſt there, the <hi>ortum</hi> is not: as the ſon hath the nature of his father, but is another thing then his father: but firſt <hi>argumentum eſt quod affectum eſt ad arguendum,</hi> then <hi>artificiale eſt affectum ex ſeſe;</hi> ſo <hi>primum</hi> is

               <q>Quod eſt ſuae originis.</q>
               <p>As if he ſhould haue ſaid, that hath this affection to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue <hi>ex ſe primitus:</hi> now then we may goe wonderfull deep, if we will goe by theſe degrees, what may we not ſee? if we would make a breefe: <hi>Argumentum eſt quod ad aliquid arguendum affectum eſt: artificiale ex ſe, primum primitus.</hi> The fallacians are many, as they that thinke they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugates that are in name: as he hath vertue, <hi>ergo,</hi> he is <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioſus:</hi> ſo <hi>homo dormit, quia ſomnit:</hi> here is nothing but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and effects, and ſo ſynonimies; for <hi>coniugata</hi> are <hi>nomina:</hi> ſo againe when <hi>orta</hi> are taken for <hi>prima,</hi> or taught before, <hi>aut contra:</hi> ſo do the common Logicians in the predicables, when they teach <hi>genus, ſpecies, differentia, proprium, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens:</hi> Firſt ſee the <hi>orta</hi> containe the <hi>prima,</hi> whence they ariſe <hi>ſymbolicè,</hi> as it were in a cognizance.

               <p>We haue heard what the end of Logick is, and all ſhoots at this marke, to reaſon well, that is, that we may handle our reaſon well; now that we may doe thus, we muſt haue inuention firſt, afterward iudgement. Inuention teacheth vs to finde out ſimples, Iudgement teacheth vs how to lay them together: we may compare inuention or arguments, to the hookes and nayles in a thing; iudgement to the faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them together. Now inuention beholds argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Argumentum</hi> in Logick is a concrete, as the Schools call it, ſignifying the thing, together with the affection that is in it to argue another thing: as a Taylor is a Taylor <hi>quatenus,</hi> he hath that affection in him to make a garment: ſo that inuention intends immediately the affection, and mediately the thing: for <hi>ens quatenus ens,</hi> is generall to <hi>ars quatenus ars,</hi> but <hi>ens quatenus</hi> it is affected <hi>ad arguendum,</hi> ſo it belongs to Logicke alone, and thus we goe by degrees; for the Lord doth not let vs ſee any thing immediately: now the very name inuention tells vs what we muſt doe, namely, ſeeke out: it tells vs the Lord hath hid things ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in nature, and we muſt labour for the ſimples, and ſo finde them: now we ſeeke <hi>argumentum,</hi> which we heard to be of two ſorts, <hi>artificiale,</hi> or <hi>inartificiale: artificiale</hi> is that which is in <hi>artificio rei;</hi> whereas the <hi>inartificiale</hi> doth but cary to vs what other men haue ſeene by the <hi>artificialls;</hi> and becauſe none can teſtifie of a thing before he haue ſeen it himſelfe, <hi>ergo, artificiale</hi> is before <hi>inartificiale:</hi> and alſo becauſe he that ſeeth <hi>inartificialiter,</hi> can but teſtifie ſo farre forth as he ſees the thing, which is not at all, <hi>ergo,</hi> they that giue teſtimony of that thing, whoſe artificiall arguments they haue not ſeene, are ſophiſters, and breake this rule: and this is a ſophiſme of the Papiſts in their implicite faith, which doe beleeue as the Church beleeueth, neither knowing the artificiall arguments of the thing, nor the thing it ſelfe that they beleeue. Now the artificiall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16408:35"/>
are in the <hi>artificio</hi> of the thing, <hi>ergo,</hi> we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity know all the artificiall arguments in things, if wee will know the things themſelues wholly. And hereby the way <hi>artificiale</hi> tells me, that euery thing muſt bee in ſome predicament, that is, in ſome art, <hi>quod ex ſeſe arguit:</hi> this affection is in the thing, and it is <hi>ex ſe,</hi> drawne out of the thing as it were: ſo that this hooke whereby it layes hold on another thing, is naturall to it, for ſo he meanes. <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiale eſt primo,</hi> or <hi>ſecundo in artificio rei,</hi> as if the thing had a ſecond kinde of making, nature, or being: ſo a thing is made of matter and forme, <hi>primitus:</hi> but when we conſider how firſt ſingular parts are made of that matter, then orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically are made of the ſingulars, and the whole made of the organicall: here is the ſecond inuention, and here the matter is conſidered immediately in the parts, mediately in the whole. This is ſomething ſubtle, but yet euident and plaine: as firſt, imagine that thing iuſtice in a man; here is <hi>ſubiectum,</hi> and <hi>adiunctum:</hi> and this is the firſt inuention: then from that quality in him, I can denominate him a iuſt man, and this is the ſecond inuention: ſo I looke at a thing whoſe matter is made of wood, and can coniugate a name to it wooden: as a wooden cheſt, &amp;c. ſo when I ſay a man is made <hi>ab humo,</hi> here is the materiall cauſe, and effect: but at the ſecond hand, when I conſider how man is made <hi>ab humo,</hi> and from thence denominate him <hi>homo,</hi> there it is that ſecond Logick. So that the firſt inuention onely looks at the thing, without conſideration of the names; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond inuention looks both at the thing, and at the names. So when I denominate <hi>homo</hi> from that thing iuſtice in him, to be <hi>iuſtus,</hi> I meane not the name, nor the thing, but the name and the thing together: for <hi>orta à primis perinde ſunt ad id quod arguunt, ſicut prima vnde oriuntur, ergo,</hi> there muſt be both the nature of the firſt arguments in them, and that <hi>affectio</hi> alſo. So in a diſtribution, if we ſhall ſpeake of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributio ex effectis,</hi> as in <hi>naui, alij malos ſcandunt, alij per fores curſitant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> here <hi>malos ſcandere, per fores curſitare, ſentinam exhaurire,</hi> are cauſes and effects firſtly; but as theſe <hi>nautae</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:16408:36"/>
are diſtributed by their effects, here is the <hi>orta categoria,</hi> the ariſing, arguing. So in a diſtribution <hi>ex cauſis</hi> of <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum</hi> into <hi>membra,</hi> the firſt inuention is matter, and forme, the ſecond inuention is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two together in the members making vp the <hi>integrum.</hi> So in a diſtribution of the <hi>genus</hi> into the <hi>ſpecies;</hi> as in <hi>animali,</hi> there is <hi>eſſentia corporea plena vitae, &amp; ſenſus,</hi> which are the cauſes of <hi>homo,</hi> and <hi>brutum:</hi> then there is a <hi>ſymbolum</hi> of them when we iumble them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: ſo in a diſtribution <hi>ex adiunctis, homo</hi> is <hi>aeger, homo</hi> is <hi>ſanus,</hi> here is both <hi>ſubiectum,</hi> and <hi>adiunctum:</hi> but when I make a diſtribution, and ſay, <hi>homo eſt aeger, aut ſanus,</hi> this is the ſecond Logick: and this is nothing but the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the community of a cauſe, an effect, a ſubiect, an adiunct, for that cauſeth theſe diſtributions: ſo in a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition there is firſtly <hi>genus,</hi> which ariſeth from matter and forme; then the ſecond inuention of them is the heaping of them together: ſo as they make but one argument, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>definitio:</hi> ſo in a diſtribution, though there may be more arguments, yet are they alſo heaped together to make one argument, namely, <hi>deſcriptio, quod eſt ſuae originis:</hi> this is true in reſpect of <hi>ortu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which made <hi>Ramus</hi> ſo define it: but I had rather reſpect the definition of <hi>argumentum, quod ad aliquid arguendum affectu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt,</hi> and ſo ſay <hi>artificiale ex ſe, primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> and ſo we ſhall deliuer it as it acteth, which is beſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primum eſt ſimplex, ſeu abſolutum, aut comparatum:</hi> I rather ſay <hi>abſolutum,</hi> becauſe <hi>abſolutum</hi> and <hi>ſimplex</hi> are more oppoſed, and ſo, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> are oppoſed, now theſe ſimple arguments doe looke at thoſe that are in <hi>artificio rei,</hi> as they are in their owne nature; for that is his meaning: as when I ſay the wall is white, here I looke at the wall as it is ſimple and abſolute in its owne nature: and in like ſort at whiteneſſe as it is ſimple and abſolute in its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo that the abſolute argument lookes euermore at the things as they are abſolute in themſelues: as when I ſay a cheſt is made of wood, I looke at both of them, as they are ſimple in their owne nature: now the comparate doth not conſider the thing abſolutely, but with another. So in a cheſt if I conſider the quantity of it, here the cheſt and its
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16408:36"/>
quantity are ſimple arguments: but when I ſay it is greater then a leſſe Cheſt, or <hi>contra,</hi> then they are comparates: ſo that the compariſon lyeth as it is reſpected with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: ſo that the comparatiue quantity, or quality is another thing the abſolute greatneſſe or littleneſſe, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or vnlikeneſſe, for that which is abſolute greatneſſe may be comparatiue littleneſſe, <hi>aut contra.</hi>

                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:16408:37"/>
that makes all things. Now as there is conſention in all things, ſo alſo there is diſſention, for elſe all things ſhould be one: thus the Lord made all things to ſhew forth his wiſedome, and mightie power, that all things ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent together, and yet be many.</p>
               <q>Conſentaneum eſt abſolute aut modo quodam.</q>
               <p>For ſome things agree abſolutely, others but after a ſort, <hi>abſolutum</hi> is abſolutely required for the being of the thing, the other is but complementall: ſo that here hee tells vs if wee would ſee any thing, firſt looke what is in <hi>artificio rei,</hi> then looke what is <hi>primitus</hi> there, then what is abſolute, then what is conſentanie, then what is ſimply required to the being of the thing. <hi>Abſolute,</hi> that is, ſo agreeing to the thing, that if the one be not there, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not be there, <hi>et contra,</hi> as if any one cauſe be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, there will be no effect, if there be a concurring of all the cauſes, then an effect, if no cauſe no effect, <hi>et contra,</hi> if an effect then all the cauſes, if no effect no concurrence of cauſes: ſo that this abſolute agreement doth put a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of each others being: now <hi>abſolute,</hi> and <hi>modo quodam</hi> are definitions of themſelues, for hee wanted words, and therefore deliuered the <hi>definitum,</hi> by the <hi>definitio:</hi> ſo that to aske a definition of <hi>abſolute,</hi> or <hi>modo quodam,</hi> is as if one ſhould aske a definition of <hi>animal ratione.</hi>

               <q>Abſolute vt cauſa et effectum.</q>
               <p>The cauſes giue <hi>eſſe</hi> to the effect, therefore without theſe <hi>eſſes</hi> the thing cannot <hi>exiſtere, ergo,</hi> they are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely required.

And againe, if any effect, then there muſt be all the cauſes; ſo then wee ſee how the ones being depends ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16408:37"/>
vpon the other, <hi>vt cauſa et effectum,</hi> therefore the cauſe muſt firſt be looked at, as if I would looke at <hi>ens,</hi> or any thing whatſoeuer, therefore our author taking this courſe takes the very way of God in his creatures. Can any man ſee any thing throughly, and not ſee the cauſes firſt? he cannot: and is there any thing to bee ſeene in a thing before the cauſes? there is not: therefore that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes firſt in nature, and therefore firſt alſo in reaſon. Now here are fallacians, as to thinke an effect may be from ſome cauſes, and to thinke the cauſes may bee remoued from the effect, which is a common fallace.</p>

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:16408:39"/>
for it is firſt in the cauſe, before it bee in the effect: then againe it is <hi>primus locus</hi> in reſpect it is the firſt argument we muſt looke at. <hi>Locus.</hi> here <hi>Ramus</hi> tells vs cloſely, that the Ariſtotelians to picke places are theſe arguments, the firſt whereof is <hi>cauſa.</hi>

               <q>Scirique demum creditur, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>For till we know the cauſes we know but the outſide of a thing, and that which may bee remoued from the thing without deſtroying the thing, but knowing the cauſes of a thing, we know it as it is, the things being ariſing from the cauſes, and thus knowing the thing, wee know it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and in <hi>cute.</hi> Here <hi>Ramus</hi> doth <hi>commorari</hi> telling vs what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> meant by theſe words: And againe too tells vs that <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> demonſtration is nothing but the <hi>ſcientia</hi> of an axiome conſiſting of <hi>cauſa,</hi> and <hi>effectum,</hi> and he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it to euery cauſe in generall efficient, matter, forme, and end.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith that a demonſtration concludes the propertie of a ſubiect by the definition, becauſe that layes forth the eſſence of a thing, but it doth not tell vs all the <hi>eſſe, ergo,</hi> not all the <hi>ſcientia,</hi> for the <hi>eſſes</hi> of the efficient and end doe not goe into a definition.</p>

               <q>Cauſa eſt efficiens, &amp; materia, aut forma, &amp; finis.</q>
               <p>Euery cauſe yeelds an <hi>eſſe,</hi> but al together make the effect, now it is of two ſorts, <hi>efficiens, &amp; materia, aut forma, &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> for he cannot giue it to vs in two words, but makes a diſtinct axiome, and couples the parts with a coniunction copulatiue, by reaſon whereof they haue a communitie, but where lyes it, this it is I may call the two firſt potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſes, the other two acting cauſes: this the Schooles tells vs, when they call <hi>materia potentia,</hi> and the forme <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and this is <hi>Ramus</hi> meaning, as wee ſhall ſee in many examples, as when a Taylor ſets buttons on a doublet with thread, they are not done till all the cauſes are there: ſo a houſe is not an houſe ſo ſoone as it hath an efficient, and matter, but when it hath alſo a forme, and end. Now our author would not vſe <hi>potentia,</hi> and <hi>actus;</hi> firſt becauſe they are barbarous words, ſecondly they are improper, becauſe they cannot be called <hi>potentia,</hi> and <hi>actus,</hi> but potentiating, and acting: then againe the forme, and end are <hi>potentia,</hi> as well as <hi>efficiens</hi> and <hi>materia, &amp; contra:</hi> therefore he makes two couple of cauſes, for ſo we ſee the efficient is the firſt mouer, mouing quite through with the matter ſingly, and the forme and end moue them inſeparably together, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are thus diſtinguiſhed, <hi>efficiens eſt motus à quo</hi> in a line, the matter <hi>ex qua,</hi> and forme <hi>per quem, finis ad quem:</hi> but becauſe there is a ſcope at matter, therefore there is a diſtinction. For as the efficient, and end terminate the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16408:40"/>
thing, ſo the forme and matter mediate the thing running quite through the ſame. So God made a matter, and gaue it a forme, and ſo an end, <hi>ergo</hi> reaſon muſt ſee them thus. The ſame order there is alſo in Gods prouidence: ſo man alſo doth imitate God, when he doth any thing orderly; the firſt care is for a workman, then a matter, then a forme, and then an end: though we may haue cloth before a tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, yet it is not a matter till it beginne with the Taylor to bring an effect to paſſe. So then the efficient is in nature before the matter, and the matter before the forme, for the forme is an adiunct to the matter, and the forme before the end, the end being an adiunct to the forme; and again a thing muſt be formed before it can haue an end. The firſt efficient had the firſt matter and formes effect to him, the ſecond formes are adiuncts to the matter. Now the firſt efficient is abſolutely firſt, for it hath nothing before it: the firſt matter is not <hi>res prima,</hi> nor <hi>cauſa prima,</hi> but firſt for matter, <hi>ergo</hi> it is from the firſt efficient onely, <hi>ergo</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath any exiſtency in the world, but is <hi>ens incompletum:</hi> ſo the firſt forme is from the firſt efficient, not of the firſt matter, but onely in it, <hi>ergo</hi> it is <hi>ens</hi> alſo <hi>incompletum:</hi> hence our ſoules are not our formes, for then our formes ſhould be <hi>res incompletae.</hi> Now the end is laſt, and the firſt end is the laſt end; it is firſt becauſe it is moſt generall, laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not made for another end, <hi>ergo</hi> it followeth of neceſſity that the laſt end is not made: ſo that the end as it is laſt, as the thing is acted: ſo it is firſt as it is moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, for all the the former cauſes worke to effect the end. As we ſay in Schooles, <hi>finis eſt primus in intentione, poſterius in executione:</hi> ſo God made all things for his glorie; here his glory is firſt in intention of him that workes by counſell, but is acted laſt of all by all things that he made.

theſe two names ſhould ſeeme to belong to naturall and morall Philoſophie, but wee are to vnderſtand by Nature that thing whoſe nature is to worke ſuch an effect: yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing be it naturall, or artificiall, which hath that <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi> of <hi>motus</hi> in it ſelfe to worke any thing.</p>
               <q>Vt quae natura vel conſilio faciunt.</q>
               <p>Counſell is that which doth a thing by deliberation willingly, and wittingly, as God, Angels, and men onely worke by counſell: <hi>cauſa natura</hi> is as a knife cutteth <hi>ſua natura,</hi> ſo all things are ſubiect to nature: and when I find that a thing worketh <hi>propria vi,</hi> and that beginning of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is with the nature of it taught, not from it nature, that is <hi>cauſa natura,</hi> as when another man crouds me, and ſo I croud another, and fling him downe, I doe it with my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not from it. So in a clocke the leade goes downe by a rule in nature, becauſe it is heauy, and that pulls the rope, and the rope pulles the wheeles, &amp;c. all theſe moue with their natures, though not from them.</p>

to Pollicy, yet for the <hi>modus</hi> of it in working an effect, it belongs to Logicke, for a man may take counſell of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, without counſellers, as Kings haue. <hi>Suſcepto bello Caeſar, &amp;c. iudicio meo, ac voluntate:</hi> in theſe words lies the <hi>modus,</hi> which hee proues <hi>à diſparatis nulla vi coactus, &amp;c.</hi> Fallaces here are very common, as when we take that for <hi>cauſa per ſe,</hi> which is <hi>cauſa per accidens, &amp; contra:</hi> Now the reaſon why hee giues theſe <hi>modi</hi> to the efficient, and not to the effect is, becauſe they are <hi>modi mouendi,</hi> and doe not belong to the thing moued.</p>

               <p>Our author before did tell vs of <hi>fortuna</hi> in the ablatiue caſe, here he puts it in the nominatiue, becauſe fortune is a principall cauſe of that effect that another doth <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens:</hi> the arguing we aſcribe it to fortune, and ſay fortune did it: ſo that our author would haue vs conſider, firſt that it was fortune did it, ſecondly, that it takes away the title of doing it from him that did it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now we come to <hi>materia,</hi> that (as we haue heard) had a community with the efficient, which community was to moue with it a great while before the forme and end come:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16408:49"/>
ſo ſoone as the efficient moues, preſently the matter moues, but the forme and end moue not a good while after. Now becauſe this difference (which cauſeth the diſtribution of <hi>cauſa</hi>) appeares in greater things, <hi>ergo</hi> it is alſo in leſſe things; but our Logicke tells vs, that the efficient muſt goe before the matter, and how agreeable doth our Logick goe to Gods worke in the creatures? if we ſhall take a thing and reſolue it into his cauſes, and make them effects, and looke at their cauſes, (for ſo when we looke at their cauſes, we make them effects: ſo that abſurd is that definition of <hi>cauſa,</hi> to be either going before, or <hi>concomitans</hi> to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) at laſt we ſhall come to a firſt efficient that hath <hi>nihil prius</hi> to him, <hi>ergo</hi> he was not made, <hi>ergo</hi> he euer was, <hi>ergo</hi> all other things once were not, for they were made, <hi>ergo</hi> they now being were from the firſt, <hi>ergo</hi> the firſt matter was not eternall, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> dreamed; but indeed hee would croſſe <hi>Plato</hi> in what he could; yet one may confute him by his owne rules, for he grants there is a <hi>primus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ergo</hi> he is <hi>mouens,</hi> but not moued, for then hee ſhould haue ſome thing to moue him, and ſo not be firſt, <hi>ergo</hi> it is eaſie to make <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> beleeue he is immoueable, becauſe he is firſt, <hi>ergo</hi> he muſt moue others only, for he is infinite, <hi>ergo,</hi> without limits of place, <hi>ergo</hi> in euery place, <hi>ergo nuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam incluſus,</hi> or <hi>excluſus, ergo</hi> vnmoueable.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt matter is firſt in his kinde, namely, the firſt matter, but not the firſt thing: and we may conclude from this, that the firſt efficient was before the firſt matter: for if both were firſt, neither were firſt: for if the one ſhould ſay he were firſt, the other would ſay nay, I am as forward as thee, and ſo there would be none abſolutely firſt: and againe, one is before two, <hi>ergo</hi> he that is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt, can be but one.</p>
               <q>Materia.</q>
               <p>For his name, as <hi>efficiens</hi> was <hi>extrafaciens,</hi> mouing all the reſt, and not moued of them, but as it were <hi>pater;</hi> ſo <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:16408:49"/>
is <hi>quaſi mater,</hi> out of which the thing ſprings, as out of a mother: ſo that we may ſee the name to be giuen <hi>à ſimili,</hi> but yet with very good reaſon; as the childe is not <hi>à patre,</hi> but of the mother; ſo the effect is from the efficient, but ſprings out of the matter. Now that there is ſuch a matter, thus it may appeare; there is nothing compoſed, but its eſſence, and it ſelfe are diſtinct: for to make <hi>eſſentia</hi> and <hi>ens</hi> to be the ſame, is peculiar to God. Againe, whatſoeuer is finite, that may be limited in his eſſence; now God onely is infinite, and euery other thing finite, <hi>ergo</hi> may be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>ergo</hi> it ſelfe and its eſſence are diſtinct, <hi>ergo</hi> it muſt haue a matter. Againe, if euery thing haue not eſſence, as they ſpeake of Angels, why are not they finite? <hi>ergo</hi> they may be defined, <hi>ergo</hi> their eſſence and themſelues are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct: againe, if they haue not a matter, what haue they? nothing but an efficient, and an end? then they ſhould be imperfect, and be either the firſt matter, or the firſt forme: againe, if they haue a forme, and no matter, then this forme muſt be another thing from them, and how is that poſſible? for if the forme and they be all one, then the cauſe and effect will be the ſame. But Logicke is a generall Art, and becauſe euery thing hath a matter, <hi>ergo materia</hi> belongs hither, and the firſt matter had not a matter, for then it ſhould not haue beene firſt, but was <hi>incomplete.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Materia eſt.</q>
               <p>For it giues <hi>eſſe,</hi> and as the force of the efficient was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the eſſeficating of the thing, ſo the matter much more, for not onely its <hi>eſſe,</hi> but its nature and ſelfe couches in the effect, and makes a bulke: and if the <hi>vis</hi> of the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent were eſſentiall, becauſe there could be no eſſefication of the effect without it, much more muſt the matter bee eſſentiall; for if we take away the matter, we take away both the force and the thing it ſelfe. Now we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that <hi>ens</hi> and <hi>non ens</hi> are the ſubiect of Logicke: and as <hi>argumentum</hi> was <hi>concretum,</hi> and alſo <hi>cauſa,</hi> ſo when I ſay <hi>materia,</hi> I meane a thing that was made of a matter.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:16408:50"/>Ex qua.</q>
               <p>That is, out of which it is raiſed, it is the mother of euery thing, as we often ſpeake of the earth: becauſe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing indeed is made of the foure elements, but more eſpecially nouriſhed of the earth. Now the matter doth not onely by his vertue cauſe the effect, but is intereſſed in it, and the effect riſeth out of it, as if it were a childe ſpringing out of the mother, onely it goes further in that its eſſence goes to the making vp of the effect: now though the eſſence be from matter and forme, yet the <hi>ens</hi> it ſelfe is from all the cauſes.</p>
               <q>Res eſt.</q>

               <p>Euery cauſe giues an <hi>eſſe</hi> to the effect, and this <hi>eſſe</hi> is the bulke of it, and from whence ariſeth the greatneſſe or little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the effect by the forme; now it is a great queſtion in Schooles whether the matter doth any thing? indeed in reſpect of the efficient it is <hi>patiens,</hi> but in reſpect of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it doth <hi>cauſare,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>agere.</hi> For if it be an effect in reſpect of euery cauſe, then euery cauſe is after a ſort the efficient of that effect: and if you aske me what his action is, I anſwer it doth <hi>materiare,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtantiare</hi> the effect, as the efficient did <hi>efficere</hi> the effect: it is alſo paſſiue in regard of the forme, but both together co-worke to make the effect; though <hi>forma</hi> be <hi>principium motus</hi> in the thing by the matter.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16408:52"/>
know are eſſentiall to the whole, that is, containing a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter, and of the forme of the whole, <hi>ergo,</hi> euery member containes a part of the <hi>eſſe</hi> of the thing, <hi>ergo,</hi> it cannot containe the whole, <hi>ergo,</hi> thoſe that make <hi>anima rationalis, ſenſitiua,</hi> and <hi>vegitatiua,</hi> formes of men, beaſts, and plants, and make it <hi>tota</hi> in <hi>toto,</hi> and <hi>tota in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet parte,</hi> breake this rule directly; for then they muſt bee deuided: but the truth is this, they are not formes, for if they bee, whereof are they formes? <hi>vinentis:</hi> what is the matter of them? as in <hi>animali:</hi> is <hi>corpus</hi> the matter of them? that cannot be, for it is <hi>forma animalis,</hi> not <hi>corporis;</hi> why then what is he but compoſed of them, <hi>ergo,</hi> they are not the matter, and forme, if there riſe a third thing from them, then the thing hath another thing then either of them, <hi>ergo,</hi> they are not the forme, but containe a portion of the matter and forme. Againe, the body hath a forme it ſelfe, for it hath his particular members, <hi>ergo,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a portion of the matter, and of the forme of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is compoſed of a forme beſides the forme of the whole, ſo that this it is, <hi>per quam,</hi> meaning it is quite through that portion of matter that makes that effect: ſo that there is not onely matter, but alſo <hi>forma</hi> in euery thing, <hi>et contra.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Res eſt, quod eſt.</q>
               <p>Therefore it eſſefies the thing, as well as the efficient, and the matter, <hi>id quod eſt:</hi> ſo that this <hi>eſſe</hi> from the forme doth not onely make it to bee, but makes it to bee that which it is: ſo that hereby we ſhall know the forme, and as for the efficient and matter, for them a cheſt might haue beene a ſtoole, or a table, but the forme onely makes it that which it is, and no other thing; againe a body is the <hi>genus</hi> to a man, <hi>ergo,</hi> not the matter, becauſe hee is <hi>corpus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we heare what the forme is, ſuch a thing as is <hi>res ſuperſtrata materiae,</hi> the matter is <hi>ſubſtrata,</hi> and the forme is layd vpon it. Now queſtion might be made what a thing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16408:53"/>
                  <hi>forma</hi> is. The efficient, and matter we ſee what they are, the cheſtitie, or tabilitie, or theſe doe deliuer the forme as well as they can, but the end deliuers it better. The way to know this is onely by the other rules of Logicke, euery member (as wee heard before) containes a portion of the matter, and the forme of the whole; how can that be? it is true, becauſe <hi>membrum</hi> is eſſentiall to the whole. Indeed the doctrine of <hi>forma</hi> hath troubled the ſchooles very much, and how to name it I cannot tell, onely it is <hi>cauſa per quam res eſt,</hi> this it is. The firſt efficient in time made the firſt matter, then hee did <hi>ſuperſtruere</hi> a forme vpon it, ſo that the matter is the foundation of the forme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is retained. Now in the elements both the matter, and forme are vniforme, and therefore their parts are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular not making a mixture, but taking hold one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſo the matter is <hi>principium paſsionis,</hi> and the forme <hi>actionis,</hi> and then againe they both conſpire, to make vp the whole. The next things are mingled of the elements, where all the elements are in euery part; by this meanes there is a matter made of the matter of the foure elements, and a forme made of the formes of the foure elements, and this is the beſt way to ſee the formes of any thing: a mans arme containes a portion of the matter, and forme of the whole: and againe, it is made of ſingular parts which ſtill containe a portion both of the matter, and of the forme of it: ſo that in the end the formes of things ariſe from the elements by miſtion; and this is that which <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> meane when they call <hi>forma craſis:</hi> ſo for artificiall things their formes ariſe from the formes of their parts: ſo that to know the formes of things this is the right, <hi>forma eſt cauſa per quam, &amp;c.</hi> Now if wee take this courſe to ſee the formes of things wee ſhall eaſily ſee the truth: looke how many members there are in a body, ſo many portions of matter, and forme there are, <hi>ergo, vita vegitatiua,</hi> and <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiua,</hi> are not the formes, but that is it that ariſeth from the vnion of the elements formes: now by this meanes neither doe we teach that the formes of things periſh, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16408:53"/>
are annihilated, as the Philoſophers ſay, neither are their formes diuers, but conſpire together to make one; neither is life a forme, ſo that a bone is a bone, and hath the forme of a bone when life is gone.</p>
               <q>Id quod eſt.</q>
               <p>This is peculiarr to the forme, for let <hi>forma</hi> bee done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from a thing, and preſently it is another thing: <hi>id quod eſt,</hi> namely that whereby it comes to be ranged vnder a generall head is from the forme.</p>
               <q>Ideoque hinc à caeteris rebus diſtinguitur.</q>
               <p>Becauſe <hi>forma eſt cauſa, &amp;c.</hi> it is not diſtinguiſhed by the efficient, or matter, becauſe all the force of them is not in the thing, as the formes force is: <hi>ideoque, &amp;c.</hi> then wee ſee euidently, that ſo farre forth as the forme runnes with the matter, ſo far forth the thing is, <hi>id quod eſt,</hi> and ſo far forth alſo is it diſtinguiſhed from all other things, now this is a neceſſary conſequution from the firſt rule.</p>

So <hi>Dialecticae partes duae ſunt,</hi> is not the firſt rule of Logicke, becauſe the definition is before, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is firſt in his kind; now the reaſon of it is this, euery conſectary that makes a rule <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; ſo that all reall diſtinction is from the forme: and here is the doctrine of <hi>differentia</hi> with other Logicians, it is nothing but a propertie: and is here <hi>ideoque hinc à caeteris rebus diſtinguitur:</hi> ſo that that which is <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16408:54"/>

               <q>Et forma ſimul cum reipſa ingeneratur.</q>
               <p>Againe, here is another property, he ſaith, <hi>forma ſimul, &amp;c.</hi> here are two things adioyned to <hi>forma,</hi> as properties, the firſt is that <hi>forma ingeneratur,</hi> the ſecond is that <hi>ſimul cum reipſa ingeneratur.</hi> For the firſt there is much queſtion how the formes come to things, the Philoſophers ſay it is an heauenly nature, and comes by influence of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, as if it were a <hi>quinta eſſentia</hi> from the elements, and muſt be extrinſice. Now theſe influences they know not what they are, if they bee qualities of the Sunne, Moone, and ſtarres, then they cannot be formes, for the formes giue eſſence, <hi>ergo,</hi> is no quality: if they be not qualities, then they are ſubſtances, what ſubſtance are they? If they be of their ſubſtance, then they are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, ſhall it be from their matter? then it ſhould be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall, for they are not made of the elements, neither can matter make a forme: and againe, it cannot be of their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for then they ſhould be diminiſhed, neither can it bee of their formes alone, for one thing cannot make a third diſtinct from it, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is not from them, but the Sunne, Moone, and ſtarres ſend downe fire, which makes a miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the other elements, and ſo from their formes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth the formes of miſts, for ſo <hi>miſtio</hi> is <hi>alteratorum vnio, ergo,</hi> it is made one, and it is euident that the formes of the foure elements are all operatiue, that is, their qualities are in euery thing. But they hold as it were a meeting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtarres together at the conception of things, but as for their worke, it is not ſo to be reſpected, for wee ſee <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> borne at the ſame time, and yet of diuers manners.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:16408:54"/>Ingeneratur.</q>
               <p>Some are of opinion, that the forme is in the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thing be, but now it is educted, and brought out; true it is, it was before in the parts, but they were not <hi>membra:</hi> ſo that after that ſort it was before, <hi>cum reipſa;</hi> how can this bee whereas the end comes betweene the forme, and the effect? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is a proprietie, and euery propriety is an adiunct to the thing, and the adiunct is after the ſubiect, ſo that this comes after the forme.</p>
               <q>Cum re.</q>
               <p>As if he ſhould tell vs the forme lies in the matter after an hidden manner, but this propertie is before the end; <hi>ingenerari</hi> is another thing, then the forme, <hi>ergo, forma</hi> is before it, but it is together with the thing.</p>
               <p>We haue made an entrance into the formall cauſe, and haue heard how that it is after the efficient, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: againe whereas euery cauſe gaue an <hi>eſſe,</hi> the forme did that, and more too, the efficient gaue a bare being, the matter gaue a being, and part of his eſſence, and the forme giues his whole eſſence, and makes it that which it is, and that reaſon of that makes it differ from all other things, and this the common Logicians did conſider when they made <hi>differentia</hi> to be <hi>diuiſiua,</hi> or <hi>conſtitutiua.</hi> Now here was their miſtaking, that they called it <hi>differentia,</hi> which doth not ariſe from the eſſence of it, but from this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that <hi>forma ſimul cum reipſo ingeneratur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The theorie of the forme is hardeſt of all humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for it cannot be ſeene with our ſenſes, but onely by the effects of it wee come to grope at it, becauſe it is <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium agens</hi> of euery thing ſtrengthned by the matter; but the contemplation of that belongs to naturall Philoſophy; and thus we may ſeeke the formes of things. When I know that <hi>membrum</hi> is <hi>eſſentiale toti,</hi> and that the matter, and

forme conſtitute the effect, it muſt needs be, that ſo many portions of matter, ſo many portions there are of <hi>forma, ergo,</hi> the Schooles are deceiued, which thinke the forme may not bee diuided, for it may, becauſe it is portionated from the members.</p>
               <p>The organicall parts of a thing are made of ſimular parts, and the ſimular parts are made of the elements, both for matter, and forme, the elements of the firſt formes; now if you aske me further what they are, I can onely ſay they are the workes of the firſt efficient incomplete in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; ſo that if you will <hi>penitùs introspicere,</hi> this is the way, and looke what element is moſt predominant in the miſt, ſo much more the neerer you ſhall come to ſee the forme ingenerated: if wee ſpeake of the formes of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they were extrinſice, and were ingenerated in the matter; againe, if we ſhall ſpeake of the ſoule of man, this is extrinſice infuſed, but the formes of other things are within, and are educed out of the matter, but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new in this, for the matter is ſo too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ingeneratur.</hi> True thus farre as the forme is not made but by compoſition of the elements, when the formes are not made, but in nature there is that miſture, or in Art that compoſition, that there is a new forme: as in a ſtone by the miſture is made one forme ariſing from the formes of the foure elements, by their action, and paſſion. So in artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall things, the forme is a compound forme made of the formes of the parts, and becauſe that thing is now that which it was not, <hi>ergo</hi> this forme muſt needs be that now, which it was not, <hi>ergo, ingeneratum:</hi> and the whole worke of the efficient whilſt he doth <hi>dolare,</hi> or hew a thing, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his preparing of it together with the reſt of the matter to make a new thing. <hi>Forma</hi> is diuerſly ingenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if it be by compoſition, then it is compoſed, if it be of ſimples, then it is made by ſhauing, or cutting it.</p>
               <p>Now whilſt he ſaith <hi>ſimul</hi> at once, it may ſeem by this that the forme, and effect are together; he meanes not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in nature, for the forme muſt bee before the effect,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16408:55"/>
becauſe it conſtitutes the effect, and the conſtituter is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thing conſtituted, therefore how are they <hi>ſimul?</hi> he meanes <hi>forma ſimul ingenerat:</hi> thus, I ſuppoſe two goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; yet one of them goeth before the other, here is a priority, and <hi>ſimul</hi> too, he that is before goeth firſt, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followeth, yet both moue together: and as two hands laid together, doe moue together, and yet one before the other, ſo is it with the formall cauſe, and effect, the formall cauſe moues, and the effect alſo, but the effect followes it in euery ſtep, and the finall cauſe followes the forme, as the ſhadow followes the body, and the effect comes laſt: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, this is a property, <hi>ergo,</hi> an adiunct, <hi>ergo,</hi> is after the ſubiect, for the forme is an effect before it be a ſubiect: ſo that the efficient doth as it were make the forme, and the effect ſtill followes, as we may ſee in artificiall things: ſo that ſo farre forth as the forme is ingenerated, ſo far forth the effect is accompliſhed.</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:16408:56"/>
that is matter, and forme: ſo that the whole nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of them, and this is the proper ſignification of it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it comes to ſignifie the <hi>principia</hi> themſelues; hence is <hi>materia,</hi> and <hi>forma</hi> called <hi>naturae:</hi> ſo that in naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, when you read of nature, they tell you common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome tale of <hi>materia,</hi> or <hi>forma:</hi> then againe by a metoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the adiunct for the ſubiect, it ſignifieth the qualities naturall in things: all this ſhewes <hi>forma</hi> to be <hi>praecipua rei natura. Praecipua,</hi> firſt becauſe it makes the thing to be <hi>id quod eſt,</hi> ſo doth not the matter: againe, <hi>forma,</hi> why it is <hi>principium actus,</hi> from whence the qualities principally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe: for as the Philoſophers teach, though not truly in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, <hi>materia</hi> is <hi>principium paſſionis: forma actionis,</hi> and <hi>actio,</hi> is better then <hi>paſſio, ergo</hi> the forme more excellent then the matter, but both matter and forme doe <hi>agere,</hi> for they are <hi>cauſae;</hi> yet the formes begin, and the matter is but the ſuſtentation of it, and the formes act is the ſtronger by the matter, not onely as it acts internally, but when it acts vpon externall things by reſiſtance by the way.

Some haue gone ſo farre as to thinke them to be influences: but ſubtile it is indeed, and harder to finde out, then either the efficient or matter, <hi>ergo</hi> wee commonly call that the matter, which containes the forme

               <p>That is the reaſon why he that makes natures is more cunning then any man can trace his wiſedome: as wee may ſee in the elements, <hi>ergo</hi> no man can make a thing in nature; man may further nature, but he cannot make any thing: againe, the parts are ſo fine in the mixture of things, as it is beyond the <hi>acies</hi> of mans eye to ſee them.</p>

               <p>Therefore the finall cauſe is that that graceth the effect, and thence hath the thing his commendation, <hi>cuius gratia,</hi> for whoſe grace; for <hi>gratia</hi> here ſignifieth not onely for whoſe ſake, but for whoſe grace, as if the finall cauſe were that which doth grace the effect, and ſo indeed it doth. For as <hi>bonum quo communius, eo melius,</hi> ſo <hi>communior finis</hi> hath more grace then <hi>finis ſpecialior:</hi> for that cauſe, that which is next the chiefeſt end is more noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then that which is more remote. Hence man is more excellent then any other creature, becauſe he is made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for God. So then the end graceth it euermore: and the more excellent the end is, the more excellent is that effect. This then is the <hi>eſſe</hi> that the finall cauſe doth giue to the effect, namely, that which is good for that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: ſo that the goodneſſe of a thing is that <hi>vis</hi> in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that it hath from the end: As in a knife, the efficient may be a ſlaue, the matter likewiſe naught, the form though that be ſomething, yet were it not for the end, neither the efficient, matter, or forme would moue, <hi>ergo</hi> the finall cauſe is ſaid to be the happines of the thing: ſo that a thing is not to be accounted happy till it be ſeruiceable to that end for which it was made. A garment well made as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the skill of the efficient, and of good ſtuffe for the matter, and fit for a garment, &amp; ſo of a good forme, yet not fitting him for whom it was made, it wanteth his end, or happineſſe, and ſo is not perfect: Againe, this ſhewes the difference betweene the formall cauſe and the end, for the forme may be as we ſee, and not the end. Againe, wee know there are many things that haue not their perfection but growth, and yet haue all the cauſes, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the end preſently followes after the forme: ſo man was made by God; here God is the efficient, earth the mat er, reaſon the forme; yet here is not his end, namely, fitneſſe to ſerue God.

               <q>Omnium artium eſt aliquod ſummum bonum &amp; finis extremus.</q>
               <p>That is that end which they reach vnto, but that is not the <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> of all things: for Logicks end is <hi>bene diſſerere,</hi> Grammars <hi>bene loqui,</hi> &amp;c. theſe are the furtheſt ends of Logicke and Grammar, but not the furtheſt end of all: they are indeed the proper end of them, but not the <hi>ſummum bonum:</hi> ſo that he meanes by <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> the outmoſt or fartheſt end of them, and the end of Logick lies in the precepts of it, as they act <hi>bene diſſerere.</hi> This is the difference betweene the end and the effect, A houſe is made to dwell in, though it neuer be dwelt in: ſo for a garment, to be worne is one thing, and to be fit to weare another. So if I goe forth to ſpeake with one, and he be gone, yet I obtaine my end: they commonly ſay he was fruſtrate of his end, but not fruſtrate of <hi>finis, quatenus finis,</hi> but <hi>quatenus effectum.</hi>

               <p>This is an imperfect tranſition containing onely the propoſition of that which followes, <hi>modo quodam:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if they bee there it is well, notwithſtanding if they bee wanting it is no preiudice to the eſſence of the thing, for they are but circumſtances, whereas <hi>argumenta abſolutè conſentanea</hi> are <hi>pentralia;</hi> againe, <hi>argumenta modo quodam conſentanea</hi> come after the being of the thing, for <hi>accidens inſeparabilis,</hi> as <hi>homini riſus aequo hinnitus,</hi> are but acts of the ſoule working in the bodies of their ſubiects.</p>
               <q>Succedit.</q>
               <p>Why? becauſe they are after thoſe that agree abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: we haue heard that the effect ariſeth from all the cauſes, and cannot <hi>exiſtere</hi> without them, <hi>ergo,</hi> it muſt be a thing of neceſſity before it be ſubiect, or adiunct, or before it can haue a ſubiect, or adiunct, for that which hath adiuncts is a ſubiect, <hi>&amp; contra.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Vt ſubiectum, &amp; adiunctum.</q>
               <p>A ſubiect is by nature before an adiunct, and a thing is firſt a ſubiect before it be an adiunct, and there muſt be a thing ſubiected to an adiunct before a thing can be adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a ſubiect: againe the ſubiect is more generall then the adiunct, not that there are more ſubiects to one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct, for it is quite contrary; for there may be twenty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts to one ſubiect, but I meane it is more in vſe, and argues more ſtrongly then the adiunct doth. As when I ſay the King is there, <hi>ergo,</hi> the Guard is there, is ſtronger then to ſay the Guard is there, therefore the King, and here we ſee as before, prioritie, and poſterioritie. Now our reaſon is to behold things according to the courſe of God, for whatſoeuer wee ſee it was firſt in God, and when hee
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16408:63"/>
hath made a thing then it is a ſubiect, and it is capable of adiuncts before it haue them, <hi>ergo, ſubiectum</hi> is before <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctum</hi> in the practiſe of God, and alſo of man. Now <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectum</hi> as it is firſt, ſo muſt it bee taught firſt. The name <hi>ſubiectum</hi> tells me it is a thing layd vndermoſt in regard of the adiunct, and it doth ſupport it, and yet it is not of the eſſence of it, but onely layd vnder it, and <hi>adiunctum</hi> is to ride on it as a packehorſe: now as the efficient was moſt inmoſt, then the other three, or the effect, ſo is <hi>ſubiectum</hi> here, <hi>ergo</hi> it is by nature before <hi>adiunctum.</hi>

               <q>Subiectum eſt cui aliquid adiungitur.</q>
               <p>He omits the <hi>genus,</hi> and the reaſon why he doth not teach the <hi>genus,</hi> namely <hi>argumentum modo quodam conſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum</hi> is becauſe, it is a definition it ſelfe, as <hi>abſolutè conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneum</hi> was, for there is no definition of a definition, but if he had defined it, he had brought a definition to a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, he wanted a word to name the thing, and therefore giues me a deſcription in ſtead thereof, <hi>cui aliquid,</hi> this <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid</hi> is that <hi>ens</hi> we heard of in Art; ſo that this <hi>aliquid</hi> is any thing, not ſimply, but <hi>quatenus</hi> it hath an affection to be ioyned. A thing being an effect, is fit to receiue out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; and <hi>ſubiectum</hi> is defined by his relate <hi>adiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> for it is <hi>cui aliquid adiungitur,</hi> and whatſoeuer is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to another thing is his adiunct, as whiteneſſe is an adiunct to a wall that is white.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Adiungitur,</hi> ſo that <hi>ſubiectum</hi> is the argument, and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctum</hi> the <hi>aliquid, adiungitur,</hi> ſo that here he tells vs that the adiunct is adioyned to the ſubiect, that which is muſt needs be after the thing to which it is tyed, <hi>ergo, ſubiectum</hi> is before <hi>adiunctum,</hi> he ſaith it is but <hi>adiunctio</hi> not entring into the eſſence of it, but that it may be taken away: ſo that as <hi>ſubiectum</hi> doth intimate a thing laid vnderneath, ſo
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16408:63"/>
the adiunct doth intimate a thing laid vpon it: ſo that the adiunct doth depend, and hang vpon the ſubiect as vpon a hooke; or as one thing tyed to another: thus haue wee heard the ſubiects argument to be ſo, as if his adiunct bee remoued from him, or he from his adiunct, yet hee ſtands firme in his cauſes. Now for the manners.</p>
               <q>Anima eſt ſubiectum ſcientiae, ignorantiae, virtutis, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii, quia haec praeter eſſentiam accedunt.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anima</hi> is a ſpirituall thing, ſo are theſe adiuncts, <hi>ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, ignorantia, &amp;c.</hi> of the ſame kinde too, now theſe take hold one of another <hi>quodam modo, ergo,</hi> if they be remoued, yet the ſoule remaines intire, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is but <hi>ſubiectum</hi> of them, <hi>ſcientia, &amp;c.</hi> Now are but adioyned to it, the <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> his <hi>eſſe</hi> is not of their <hi>eſſe, aut contra.</hi> Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (as <hi>Scaliger</hi>) that the Angels, and mens ſoules <hi>eſſe,</hi> and <hi>agere,</hi> are the ſame, but then their <hi>actus</hi> ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall: againe then they haue no adiuncts, then no cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then God, <hi>ergo,</hi> they haue their qualities.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi> But how are theſe ioyned to the ſoule? it hath two faculties; reaſon, and will, now the faculties of the vnderſtanding are the intellectuall vertues, when it can promptly, and readily performe its act, as when it is prompt and ready in inuenting, then it is <hi>intelligentia,</hi> when it is prompt in ſeeking out truths, then it is <hi>ſcientia,</hi> when it is ready in diſcourſing, then it is <hi>ſapientia, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that theſe intellectuall vertues are habits of the facultie of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and lye in the promptneſſe of its act: ſo by vertues he meanes morall vertue, nor intellectuall, and that is of the will. For when the will can promptly performe the act of bountifulneſſe, or iuſtice, then it is in like ſort libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, or iuſtice, and ſo for the reſt, and the contrary makes vice, <hi>ergo,</hi> theſe are but adiuncts, <hi>quia praeter eſſentiam ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedunt,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:16408:64"/>
that is, theſe come ouer, and aboue the eſſence. The ſoule is <hi>tanquam tabula abraſa,</hi> and theſe vertues come afterward.</p>

               <p>Here that which we heard of in adiuncts is <hi>res locata:</hi> becauſe it doth apply that ſpeciall kinde of adiunct that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, to this ſubiect <hi>locus.</hi> Now it is not eſſentiall to the thing, <hi>ergo</hi> is but complementall: againe, that which is now in one place may remoue to another place, <hi>ergo</hi> is not abſolutely conſenting to the thing: and thus we ſee it muſt needs belong to Logicke, as being but in reſpect: they ſay onely <hi>corpus</hi> is in <hi>loco deſcriptiue,</hi> and not ſpirits, they are but in <hi>vbi,</hi> or in <hi>loco deſignatione:</hi> but what is this but a rule of Geometry? where we heare of <hi>completio loci</hi> by <hi>corpus:</hi> and therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> brings <hi>locus</hi> to quantity. Then againe they queſtion whether the ſpace that containes a thing bee <hi>locus</hi> or no. Anſw. Space belongs to nature, and is nothing but the meaſure that doth fill the place, and is nothing but that <hi>quadrangula ſex complent locum,</hi> or a pint
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16408:65"/>
will receiue a pinte; and therefore to receiue is to meaſure the ſpace. I confeſſe you may name it in Nature, but not define it.</p>

               <p>Here hee ſpeakes according to the common conceits in Schooles, but I maruell how hee or any other can ſay ſo. <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, they are in diuine predicament of quantity, but not in this groſſe predicament of quantity, and they haue a figure. In what figure were Angels firſt created? An. In what figure was water firſt made? they can take any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure as water can; but I think they were firſt made in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of roundneſs. So <hi>Ariſt:</hi> ſaith they were made as <hi>puncta.</hi> So is fire round, for that is <hi>figura capaciſſima, ergo, perfectiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima.</hi> I haue thought alſo that the Arke was made for all the world like a man, and there was the proportion of length proportionable to a mans bredth, and the heighth proportionable to a mans thickneſſe. Now for the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of parts it is not ſo; for Angels may be diuided, though their parts be ſimilar: ſo are the elements parts; and as ſome write, the wicked ſpirits may be ſtrucke, and ſo the Sun light, but it will too quickly returne into it ſelfe: and as the light may be diuided, ſo may they. And whereas they ſay, <hi>anima</hi> is <hi>tota in toto,</hi> and <hi>tota in qualibet parte,</hi> they wrong God, and the creature; for what is the reaſon? God can haue no parts, <hi>ergo</hi> no cauſes; other things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer muſt needs haue cauſes, <hi>ergo</hi> muſt haue <hi>membra, ergo</hi> we cannot ſay they are all in euery part. Yes, the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule is in my little finger? Content, but is that very
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16408:65"/>
portion of it that is in my head, alſo in my little finger? There is a diſcontinuance, and the ſame thing ſhould bee here, and not there, which is flat contradiction: but God is not in this or that finger, but alſo betweene them. The Papiſts abſurditie appeares notably in this, in that they will haue Chriſts body to be really in the Sacrament in the bread, and in heauen alſo, and yet not in the ayre, but make a diſcontinuance: <hi>ergo</hi> it is in the bread, and not in the bread; in heauen, and not in heauen; for if it is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, there it is ſhut vp, and ſo in the bread.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Adiunctum</hi> doth preſently tell me, that there is ſome thing <hi>cui aliquid adiungitur:</hi> he rather ſayes <hi>ſubiicitur</hi> then <hi>adiungitur,</hi> becauſe <hi>adiunctum</hi> hath reference to <hi>ſubiectum,</hi> and it is better to define them from the relation betweene them, then <hi>à comparatis;</hi> becauſe relats are mutuall cauſes one of another. Now here he ſhewes that the adiunct is that that is builded vpon the ſubiect: and as the ſubiect did preſuppoſe a thing already made, but muſt ſupport another thing; ſo <hi>adiunctum</hi> tells me it is a thing already
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16408:67"/>
made, but muſt lye vpon the ſubiect: <hi>ſubiectum</hi> ſignifies a ſupporter, or a ſuppoſitory as it were: <hi>adiunctum,</hi> that is more common then <hi>ſubiectum,</hi> and <hi>ſubiectum</hi> lyes alway vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but <hi>adiunctum</hi> it may either lye ouer, or vnder, or be tacked to either ſide, yet it will fall off, vnleſſe it be nayled, or adioyned to the ſubiect. Now that which tackes it to the ſubiect is that affection which it hath to <hi>ſubiectum,</hi> euery thing will not be an adiunct to euery thing, nor eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing a ſubiect to euery thing. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, if we bray a foole in a morter, as wheat is brayed, he will not be wiſe: the reaſon is, for that his ſpirits are ſo dry, dull, and earthy. Now wiſedome hath ſo fine a hand, as that ſhee cannot take hold of ſuch hard things, but they will hurt it, ſo that it cannot be <hi>ſubiectum</hi> or <hi>adiunctum</hi> to any thing: and this ſhewes that Logicke is in the things in nature, and not in mans braine onely. So this rule wills vs to looke how <hi>ſubiectum</hi> is able to ſupport the adiunct, and when he ſees how God hath done them for him, to vſe them to his turn. Againe, this rule is of great vſe to ſee how things are tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together in nature, ſo as the one being taken away the other will remaine entire: then againe, though the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct in nature cannot be ſeuered from the ſubiect, yet by my eye of Logicke I can ſeuer them.</p>
               <q>Quod argumento etſi ſub: eſt leuius, attamen eſt copio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, &amp; frequentius.</q>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16408:67"/>
the thing: ſo that <hi>adiunctum</hi> will be <hi>leuius,</hi> if wee weigh them in a paire of ballance: which appeares many waies: as if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fanſhaw</hi> be at London, his ſeruants are there: this is more ſtrong arguing then to ſay <hi>contra.

               <q>Vt autem locus eſt in ſubiectis, ſic tempus eſt in adiunctis.</q>
               <p>That <hi>locus</hi> wee heard of before was <hi>ſubiectum,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a generall affection, <hi>ergo</hi> it belongeth to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, and it was nothing but the application of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, to a contained: ſo time is nothing but the application of one thing to another thing; as when I ſay he came on munday, or at three of the clocke, that is not time, but the adiunct of time: and here is the application of the courſe of <hi>primum mobile,</hi> or of the Clocke to his act: it is <hi>duratio,</hi> the meting of a thing. Time may well be compared to a line; and as <hi>fluxus punctum</hi> is <hi>linea,</hi> ſo <hi>fluxus nunc</hi> is <hi>tempus:</hi> he went in the turning of a hand, that is, whileſt one might haue turned his hand: ſo that I meaſure it by the durance, not by his length, or Geometry.</p>
               <q>Rei.</q>
               <p>For Logicke is <hi>rei:</hi> and as <hi>cauſa</hi> is <hi>res,</hi> ſo <hi>tempus eſt res,</hi> or <hi>duratio rei,</hi> that is of the ſubiect <hi>praeſens, praeterita, &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura:</hi> here he doth diſtribute this time, to ſhew that this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16408:68"/>
diſtribution of time belongeth to Logicke, and not to any other Art. Much deſcanting there is about time among other Logicians, which teach that it hath a double reſpect, one to the thing meaſured, and ſo it is properly time, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the thing meaſuring, and that is not time, but as one is meaſuring it: now for the logicall notion of time it is all one whether it be actiue, or paſſiue, and it is one and the ſame thing diuerſly reſpected, and becauſe actiue and paſſiue goe alwayes together, <hi>ergo,</hi> the time muſt needs be generall to both; <hi>praeterita, praeſens</hi> and <hi>futura.</hi> So for things that are ſubiect to our Logicke are diuided into paſt, preſent, and to come, for onely God is not ſubiect to time, becauſe he is eternall, <hi>ergo</hi> is <hi>omne non eſſe ante poſt,</hi> neither can we ſay he is now if we reſpect time, for what ſhould meaſure him, ſhould <hi>primum mobile,</hi> or day &amp; night? no, ſo that though he be at all times according to our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, yet he is without reſpect of time at all times, for time is not eternall, <hi>ergo,</hi> not <hi>omne non eſſe ante poſt.</hi> And Grammar which is the garment of Logick, doth ſpeake by the verbe of time paſt, preſent, and to come; now we giue it in Grammar to verbes, not but that it may bee giuen to euery thing, as well as to actions, and paſſions, but that we deliuer it actiuely or paſſiuely.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>primum mobile</hi> which God hath made a common globe to all the world, and is meaſured according to <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terita, praeſens,</hi> and <hi>futurae, ergo,</hi> time is in euery thing, and Angels, and mens ſoules are without reſpect of <hi>primum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> and day and night: becauſe they are beyond them, but they are not without duration paſſiue, becauſe they were made creatures by God: ſo that though their <hi>tempus</hi> be called <hi>auum,</hi> yet is it this <hi>tempus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi> May <hi>praeteritum</hi> being paſt be ſaid to be: no, if we reſpect <hi>praeſens,</hi> for they are as wee ſee here diſtinct things, but if we reſpect the thing, it is, yet not in time, but in its eſſence: how in it eſſence? not as it doth <hi>exiſtere in rerum natura,</hi> but as it is in a rule, that is eternall: ſo that though <hi>Socrates</hi> now be not, yet this axiome <hi>Socrates eſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16408:69"/>
homo</hi> is now, and will be to the worlds end: ſo <hi>praeteritum, praeſens,</hi> and <hi>futurum</hi> all of them are, for wee doe not reſpect the adſignification of time, but looke at the argument as it is a being: ſo that time future is a true thing, though the time be not yet come: and that <hi>duratio</hi> paſt, preſent, and to come are, becauſe the thing ſtill is: ſo that time is an adiunct. But here as <hi>locus</hi> muſt bee a thing with that affection of receiuing, ſo time muſt bee a thing with this affection of meaſuring.</p>
               <q>Omninoque qualitates ſubiectis praeter cauſas adiunctae, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Againe, another <hi>modus</hi> of <hi>adiunctum</hi> is called <hi>qualitates,</hi> which is adioyned to this, or that, not being cauſes, here comes in their praedicament of <hi>qualitas,</hi> and <hi>qualitas</hi> is no <hi>genus</hi> of any thing, <hi>ergo,</hi> that diſtinction of <hi>qualitas</hi> to bee <hi>naturalis,</hi> or <hi>moralis</hi> is not at all, but a ſpeciall vſe of a thing that is taught in a generall Art, for <hi>qualitas</hi> is but a logicall terme, and as <hi>adiunctum</hi> is <hi>genus</hi> to them, ſo is <hi>qualitas.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery example is <hi>infima ſpecies</hi> in Logicke: ſo that <hi>calor</hi> is an adiunct to fire, and when I haue ſaid ſo, I haue conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the logicall reſpect, and no more.</p>
               <q>Praeter cauſas.</q>
               <p>Wee haue heard that there can bee nothing but muſt haue cauſes: and ſo the <hi>exiſtere</hi> of a thing is from the <hi>eſſes</hi> that the cauſes giue, and then the adiuncts come ouer, and aboue the thing. Now qualities are of two ſorts, proper and common, theſe are but ſpeciall <hi>modi</hi> of theſe qualities: they may be proper, becauſe they argue at proper, common becauſe they argue at common, or at randome, as wee ſay. Now whatſoeuer hath affection to argue, that belongs to Logicke, <hi>ergo,</hi> theſe, becauſe they haue affection to argue, rather as <hi>modi,</hi> then as adiuncts; as <hi>modi efficientis</hi> before So therefore they are diſtinguiſhed thus. So <hi>riſus</hi> doth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16408:69"/>
argue <hi>homo,</hi> not ſo much in regard of his adiunctity as of its property. Now <hi>qualitates propriae</hi> haue theſe properties with them, <hi>conueniunt</hi> they come together with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and are <gap reason="foreign">

               <q>Tametſi ſua diſſenſione, clarius eluceſcant.</q>

he is oppoſed directly, as he is not <hi>brutum:</hi> and ſo hee is a contrarie.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16408:78"/>
ſo that in Diuinity we know there is nothing added to the Godhead by giuing to it the perſons mutually. <hi>Sunt contra,</hi> here is one to one, for though a father haue many children, yet the relation is but one, namely, betwixt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, and ſonhood; and though many ſtand on the one ſide, yet there is but one relation: ſo in the high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Trinitie, there is a double relation, firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Father, and the Sonne; ſecondly between the Father, and the Sonne on the one ſide, and the holy Ghoſt on the other ſide.

Some would haue relates taught as conſentanie arguments, becauſe they doe agree; it is true, but they doe diſagree alſo, and if they ſhould be taught in conſentanies, their <hi>diſſentio</hi> alſo ſhould bee taught there, or elſe they ſhould make a double doctrine of one thing, and this kinde of teaching had beene <hi>à poſteriore;</hi> againe where ſhould they haue beene taught? they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cauſes, <hi>ergo,</hi> not <hi>cauſa</hi> and <hi>effectum,</hi> but both cauſes and effects: againe, the doctrine of <hi>cauſa efficiens, materia, forma,</hi> and <hi>finis</hi> are diſtinct: here they are confounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one. Now the Ariſtotelians haue a predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of relates, and haue alſo their <hi>ſeries,</hi> but their <hi>gradus</hi> of them will not ſtand, for relates haue no <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but are loweſt ſaue onely examples: and they goe cleane out, and ſay relates are of this nature, or that nature, as if they ſhold

               <q>Relata dicuntur ſimul eſſe natura.</q>
               <p>The reaſon ſtands in this, the whole being of the one relate is contained in the other, <hi>ergo,</hi> they are <hi>ſimul,</hi> for if they be mutuall cauſes, they muſt bee mutuall effects, <hi>ergo,</hi> as one is the cauſe, ſo the other is the effect, <hi>&amp; contra, ergo,</hi> they muſt be <hi>ſimul.</hi>

one thing, either as a relate, or in <hi>aduerſa:</hi> now we come to ſhew how a thing being from his cauſes, is not a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

               <p>Where there was a fight of one to one.</p>
               <q>Negantia.</q>
               <p>Here one of them is nothing, <hi>ergo</hi> it cannot properly be ſaid that here is one to one; yet our Logick here makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſomething, <hi>per oppoſitum ens,</hi> and in very deed it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that <hi>ens</hi> being from his cauſes, that it ſhould not be another thing, ſo it ſhold not be nothing. <hi>Negantia,</hi> not that he ſpeaks here of the negation, that we ſhall heare of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in an axiom, but he meanes a not being. <hi>Ramus</hi> had not a better word, <hi>ergo</hi> he keepes this deliuering it in the actiue voice, deſiring to commend to vs the act, or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the faculty whereby arguments doe act.

               <q>Sunt.</q>
               <p>For as there is a ſomething ſo there muſt be a nothing; becauſe euery thing that is, (except <hi>ens primum</hi>) as it was not once, ſo may it not be againe.</p>
               <q>Quorum alterum ait, alterum negat idem.</q>
               <p>That is, the one is a thing in <hi>rerum natura: alterum negat,</hi> that is, the other is not a thing in <hi>rerum natura.</hi> Hee hath not better words to vtter them to the act of our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>ergo</hi> borrowes theſe words, <hi>ait, negat,</hi> which are a

metonimy of the adiunct for the ſubiect; but remoue the Rhetoricke, and you ſhall ſee what he meanes.</p>
               <q>Idem.</q>
               <p>For it is by <hi>oppoſitum ens,</hi> that <hi>non ens</hi> is <hi>ens:</hi> and it is by reaſon of nothings contradicent, that nothing is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Here we ſee the force of reaſon, that maketh <hi>non ens</hi> to be <hi>ens,</hi> but it is by <hi>oppoſitum ens</hi> onely: ſo that if there were not an <hi>idem,</hi> they were not contraries, no not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But might it not haue beene left out, being taught generally before? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> No: there muſt be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the ſame thing, for the whole entity that we giue to a negant, is <hi>per oppoſitum ens, ergo</hi> it muſt haue reference to <hi>idem.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Sunt contradicentia, aut priuantia.</q>
               <p>As the conſentanies proceeded from cauſes to effects, and ſo to ſubiects and adiuncts: ſo do diſſentanies diſagree leſſe or more. The leſſe diſſenting arguments muſt goe before, becauſe they are common to the other, and are contained in them: now oppoſites are not this or that, by a leſſer or a more earneſt oppoſition; contraries are of one thing to another, or of one thing to nothing; and here is a ſharper contention: and againe, among theſe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicent, though it take away the ſame thing <hi>vbique,</hi> yet it leaues ſomething in roome of it. <hi>Sunt contraria negantia,</hi> which we heard before.</p>
               <q>Quorum alterum negat vbique.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quorum alterum,</hi> namely the denyer; <hi>negat vbique,</hi> that is in euery ſubiect, and puts another thing in roome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>viſus, non viſus, non viſus</hi> denyes <hi>viſus</hi> in my eye, hand, and foot, and in euery part of my body, yet it doth not take away euery thing, but there may be ſome thing that ſhould be there.</p>

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:16408:83"/>Negat vbique.</q>
               <p>Good reaſon, for when it purſues the contrary in euery part, it cannot be ſo ſtrong a fight, as where the contrary fights with the other in the ſame ſubiect; <hi>vt iuſtus non iuſtus,</hi> for the vſe of them, we ſeldome finde them directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but in an axiom we chiefly finde them: as when I ſay, it is ſo, it is not ſo: or we ſhall finde them often by way of mocking, as when we cry at a thing, and ſay, If it be not, it is not: here is the antecedent negatiue, and the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affirmatiue.</p>
               <q>Sic in defenſione Murenae, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nihil ignoueris,</hi> ſaith the Stoicke, <hi>imo aliquid, non omnia.</hi> Here be contradicent axioms, making one axiom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of contradicent arguments. So that by this example we may ſee where they are vſed. They are called <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia,</hi> becauſe the contrariety is in the denyall of the word affirmed, <hi>quaſi contrarietas in dictione,</hi> but it is in <hi>re</hi> indeed: ſo that this is contradiction, when two talke together, and the one denies that which the other ſaid, as <hi>Diues, non Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, bella, non bella, puella, non puella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Cicero</hi> counts <hi>Atticus</hi> an Epicure by profeſſion, that <hi>mortui non ſunt miſeri,</hi> becauſe <hi>non ſunt:</hi> now when we find contradiction in a ſpeech, we ſhew it by the rule; we finde many arguments among the Papiſts to be of this kinde, and alſo among our owne men.

               <p>Therefore it is imperfect wanting the propoſition, the name comes of <hi>con,</hi> and <hi>paro,</hi> to bring together, or lay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo that howbeit the denomination of comparates may ſeeme to riſe principally from parity, yet we muſt take them more generally, becauſe <hi>impartia, ſimilia,</hi> and <hi>diſſimilia</hi> are alſo compared, but are vnmatches, for as our Engliſh word Matches may bee taken for equall matches, or vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, ſo may the latine word <hi>comparata</hi> be taken for <hi>paria,</hi> or <hi>imparia, &amp;c.</hi>

               <q>Saepeque notis breuius iudicantur, aliquando partibus plenius diſtinguntur.</q>

Again, this is generall to euery thing, not ſpeciall to Geometry: and the reaſon hereof we heard to be, becauſe there are more things in nature, then there are degrees in quantity; it was <hi>parium,</hi> or <hi>imparium.

               <p>We haue heard concerning quantity, that <hi>paria</hi> were <hi>quorum vna eſt quantitas, imparia ſunt quorum non eſt vna quantitas,</hi> that is, as parity was the quantity of <hi>paria,</hi> ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity is the quantity of <hi>imparia.</hi>

Againe, <hi>ſimilia</hi> muſt goe before <hi>diſſimilia,</hi> as quantity went before quality, becauſe it did ariſe immediately from the limits of the eſſence: now qualities are the acts of the forme vpon the matter, and there is no act till the eſſence bee limited, <hi>ergo</hi> till the thing hath quantity, <hi>ergo</hi> quantity is firſt.

               <q>Similitudo proportio dicitur, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Here he doth <hi>commorari,</hi> becauſe the Schooles haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed this property, teaching that it doth belong to quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: ſo we alſo abuſe it in our common ſpeech, as when we ſay he is a well proportioned man, when we meane that his members are correſpondent, or like one to another. <hi>Vt ſimilia proportionalia:</hi> this alſo followes, which alſo ſhewes that <hi>proportio</hi> belongs hither.</p>

Now a diſtribution doth ariſe from any conſentany arguments, or common, becauſe that a cauſe may be common to more effects, <hi>&amp; contra;</hi> and a ſubiect to more adiuncts, <hi>&amp; contra:</hi> hence it comes to paſſe that a thing may be diſtributed, a common cauſe into ſpeciall effects, <hi>aut contra,</hi> a common ſubiect into ſpeciall adiuncts, <hi>&amp; contra.</hi> And this we ſee to be very true in nature by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples: ſo that <hi>diſtributio</hi> is nothing but taking a common cauſe, or ſubiect, and diuiding it into ſpeciall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or adiuncts, <hi>aut contra.</hi>

               <p>This is an imperfect tranſition, and indeed containeth a diſtribution; as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>ortum</hi> is <hi>reliquum,</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi> A diſtribution is from common cauſes, and a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſe, and that is perfect: or from ſome conflux of other arguments, which the Schooles call properties, and that is <hi>deſcriptio.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>In qua vtraque pars affectio reciprocationis eſt.</q>
               <p>That is, this is a property to them. Now he ſaith <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio,</hi> becauſe <hi>argumentum eſt quod affectum eſt ad arguendum.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, theſe arguments are affected to argue with a mutuall receiuing of themſelues, as the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines iuſt as much as the parts, <hi>&amp; contra,</hi> the definition, as the definite, <hi>&amp; contra.</hi> So that this reciprocation for all the world is like vnto two Iuglers pots, where the one will hold iuſt as much water as the other, and neither more nor leſſe: ſo then the whole is not the parts, nor the <hi>definitum</hi> the <hi>definitio,</hi> onely there is this mutuall affection of recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation betwixt them; that is, they haue that affection as that the parts <hi>ſimul ſumptae</hi> will reach no further then the <hi>totum, aut contra;</hi> the definition, then the definite, <hi>aut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> as when I ſay a man is ſicke, or well, here the parts may agree to other things then to man. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> True, but we muſt vnderſtand it, as if it were ſaid, <hi>homo</hi> is either <hi>homo aeger,</hi> or <hi>homo ſanus,</hi> now this reciprocation in a diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution is of all the parts together with the whole.</p>
               <q>Diſtributio eſt cum totum in partes diſtribuitur.</q>
               <p>Hauing ſhewed the generall affection, he now comes to tell what diſtribution is: it is called diſtribution in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſignification in reſpect of the parts; now diſtribution is the <hi>categoria,</hi> and the parts and the whole are the <hi>catego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remata.</hi>

               <q>Totum eſt, quod continet partes.</q>
               <p>It is that which holdeth together the parts: <hi>continet,</hi> becauſe all the parts are in the whole, as in one, as being the common head wherein they are.</p>
               <q>Pars eſt, quae continetur a toto.</q>
               <p>For the container is the <hi>totum,</hi> and the parts the contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſo that the doctrine of <hi>diſtributio</hi> is but to teach vs how to range and cary euery thing to his home. It is a great queſtion among the Phyſitians, whether a wen be a part of a mans body, or no. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is <hi>morbus, ergo,</hi> no part: it is <hi>in toto,</hi> but not contained <hi>à toto,</hi> for the whole containes the members by reaſon of its forme, if we ſpeake of <hi>integrum,</hi> but the forme reacheth not to this.</p>
               <q>Atque vt diſtinctio totius in partes, diſtributio: ſic collectio partium, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Many Logicians haue made this to belong to <hi>argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio,</hi> but they are deceiued, for they belong hither, and it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16408:98"/>
is the ſame to doe and vndoe, to diuide the whole into parts, and to <hi>colligere</hi> the parts to make vp the whole.</p>
               <q>Diſtributio ſumitur ex argumentis toti quidem conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneis, inter ſe autem diſſentaneis.</q>
               <p>Here hee ſheweth from whence diſtribution ariſeth, namely, from conſentanies, in reſpect of the parts with the whole, and alſo from diſſentanies, either diſparats or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, in reſpect of the parts betweene themſelues.</p>

               <p>This is a deduction from that that went before; for if the former be true, then this alſo: now the greateſt diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of contraries, and the greateſt of all is betweene ſomething and nothing, <hi>ergo</hi> to diſtribute into tricotomies, and quadricotomies, &amp;c. is to skip ouer ſome thing that ſhould bee taught.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning this doctrine of <hi>diſtributio,</hi> we haue heard the generalitie: the ground from whence a diſtribution doth ariſe, is for that the firſt arguments are common: as a common cauſe may bee diſtributed by the effects, in like ſort a common effect may bee diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into ſpeciall cauſes: and ſo for the ſubiect and adiunct:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16408:99"/>
ſo that beſide that community there is nothing new in this ſecond inuention. In a diſtribution we obſerued a whole, and a part: the whole containes the parts, and the parts are contained of the whole, <hi>ergo</hi> if either the whole containe not all the parts, or all the parts be not contained of the whole, there will be no diſtribution. Now theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments did ariſe from conſentanies, in reſpect of the whole, but from diſſentanies <hi>inter ſe. Itaque tanto accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior erit, &amp;c. ergo</hi> a diſtribution into a dicotomy which is of contraries is the beſt; yet if it cannot be had, wee muſt be faine to make a tricotomy: now we come to the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of diſtribution.</p>
               <q>Diſtributio prima eſt ex abſolute conſentaneis, cauſis nempe, &amp; effectis.</q>
               <p>A diſtribution is a deriuatiue argument from cauſe, or from <hi>modo quodam conſentaneorum vt ſubiectorum, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctorum.</hi> Now the vſe of diſtribution is this, that wee may range euery thing in his owne order and place, for when we haue ſeene a thing in his <hi>eſſe,</hi> and <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> and then that it is not this or that; and haue alſo compared it with other things, to ſee whether it be equall or vnequall, like or vnlike, and likewiſe haue giuen it a name; in the next place it is requiſite, that we ſet it in his ranke, for ſo the Lord hath ranged euery thing in the world, as man vnder his <hi>genus animal,</hi> for the Lord hath made all things lyable to our Logicke, <hi>ergo</hi> they muſt bee ranged vnder ſome head, that wee may ſee how they agree, and how they diſagree.</p>

               <p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16408:99"/>
becauſe <hi>cauſa</hi> and <hi>effectum</hi> are <hi>prima:</hi> ſecondly, as they are before <hi>ſubiectum</hi> and <hi>adiunctum.</hi> Hee takes <hi>diſtributio</hi> here in the actiue ſignification, and according thereunto muſt the <hi>ſpecies</hi> be proſecuted, for he doth define them from the parts diuiding. For the notation of the word (which giues great light) it comes of <hi>tribuo,</hi> and <hi>dis,</hi> as if it ſignified that diſtribution that iuſtice giues: it is a terme belonging to Law, as many of our logicall termes doe: and here it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a ſeuering of the parts, and a giuing to euery part his due: as when a common cauſe is diſtributed, and then to euery ſpeciall effect his owne cauſe is giuen: ſo that here is nothing in this new inuention, but this diſtribution, the reſt is the firſt inuention: as when I ſay a man is ſicke, and a man is well, here are two ſubiects, and two adiuncts: but when I ſay of men, ſome are ſick, &amp; ſome are well, here is a diſtribution. Now the reaſon why he ioyneth both <hi>cauſa</hi> and <hi>effectum</hi> together, ſaying, <hi>ex abſolute conſentan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>is, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis nempe, &amp; effectis,</hi> is becauſe that in a diſtribution as there are parts, ſo there is a whole; <hi>diſtributio</hi> being both actiue and paſſiue, though it bee principally denominated from the parts: ſo that where the cauſe is the whole, there the effects muſt be parts.</p>
               <q>Diſtributio ex cauſis eſt, quando partes ſunt cauſae totius.</q>
               <p>So that here the effect is the whole, and the cauſes are the parts: now he proſequutes the doctrine of diſtribution by the parts, becauſe he goes according to the act of things, and the parts here conſtitute the whole: againe, a whole, the very name doth deny a diſtribution; for if it be whole it is not diſtributed: but the parts ſhew a whole, <hi>ergo</hi> wee muſt apply diſtribution to the parts; hence <hi>diſtributio ex cauſis</hi> is not when the cauſe is a whole, but when the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are parts: hence a <hi>diſtributio ex integro</hi> is before a <hi>diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butio ex genere,</hi> becauſe there the parts are effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſtributio ex cauſis</hi> is here the firſt inuention, in that he

ſaith <hi>ex cauſis,</hi> the ſecond inuention in that he ſaith <hi>diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butio.</hi> Againe, there is the firſt inuention, when he ſaith, <hi>quando partes ſunt cauſae;</hi> the ſecond inuention when hee ſaith, <hi>quando partes ſunt cauſae totius;</hi> ſo that take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon effect, and make it a whole; the cauſes, and make them parts, and this is the ſecond inuention.</p>
               <q>Hîc diſtributio integri in ſua membra praecipuè laudatur.</q>
               <p>This now is a ſpeciall <hi>modus</hi> of <hi>diſtributio ex cauſis,</hi> there may be a diſtribution of the effect, by the efficients, by the materialls, by the formalls, and from the end: but he doth not ſtay vpon them, but preſently comes to the <hi>diſtributio integri in membra,</hi> becauſe it is of greater vſe, and of more practiſe.</p>
               <q>Hic.</q>
               <p>That is in the <hi>diſtributio ex cauſis:</hi> ſo that <hi>membra</hi> are parts, but all parts are not <hi>membra:</hi> and <hi>integrum</hi> is <hi>totum,</hi> but euery <hi>totum</hi> is not <hi>integrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Praecipuè laudatur.</q>
               <p>Why? firſt becauſe it is of ſo great vſe: ſecondly, becauſe it is more ſecret, the other more familiar.</p>
               <q>Integrum eſt totum, cui partes ſunt eſſentiales.</q>
               <p>The <hi>integrum,</hi> the entire as wee call it, is <hi>totum,</hi> that is, <hi>quod continet partes, ergo</hi> the <hi>membra</hi> muſt be contained of the <hi>integrum,</hi> giuing thereunto both portion of matter, and portion of forme: hence nailes and hayres are not <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi> of a mans body, becauſe they giue not a portion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and forme to it.</p>

               <p>So then if the members be eſſentiall to the whole, they giue eſſence to it, that is, they afford <hi>cauſa:</hi> now <hi>eſſentia</hi> ſtands principally in the matter, and forme, <hi>ergo</hi> he meanes theſe parts giue matter, and forme to the whole.</p>

               <p>This diſtribution is now to good purpoſe, for the ſchooles haue not agreed at any time of any perfect defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, as they ſay <hi>homo eſt animal rationale,</hi> this is not a perfect definition, <hi>ergo,</hi> ſome doe adde <hi>mortale,</hi> ſome <hi>capax diſciplinae:</hi> ſome both: ſo that indeed we cannot giue a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect definition of any thing, <hi>ergo,</hi> becauſe it is ſo hard to find the ſpeciall forme, it is requiſite to haue an imperfect one to grope out the forme thereby, elſe we ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, if wee could no way looke at the eſſence of things, and here by the way we ſee the quiddity laid out perfectly by a perfect definition, and imperfectly by an imperfect definition.</p>

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16408:110"/>
ſynecdochicall; now that <hi>explicatio</hi> of the thing is perfect or imperfect: the one called <hi>definitio,</hi> the other <hi>deſcriptio;</hi> the one containing the limitation of the eſſence, the other the limitation of the quantity: ſo that whatſoeuer hath an eſſence diſtinct from it ſelfe muſt be limited, <hi>ergo,</hi> may be defined: <hi>ergo,</hi> haue their perfect definition, though we cannot ſee what their forme is.</p>
               <q>Definitio perfecta eſt definitio conſtans è ſolis cauſis eſſentiam conſtituentibus.</q>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe it ſtands of more parts, namely the <hi>genus,</hi> and forme, laying out the compoſition of the thing.</p>
               <q>E cauſis.</q>
               <p>As if he ſhould ſay, they doe giue <hi>exiſtere</hi> to the definite.</p>
               <q>Solis.</q>
               <p>Becauſe no other arguments come in a perfect definition.</p>
               <q>Eſſentiam conſtituentibus.</q>
               <p>That is, <hi>materia,</hi> and <hi>forma,</hi> but <hi>materia</hi> is included in <hi>genere:</hi> ſo that <hi>definitio</hi> is <hi>ortum</hi> doubly, now there are foure cauſes which giue <hi>eſſe,</hi> but two of them onely giue eſſence, ſo that the effect hath his ſubſtance from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and forme, not from the other cauſes.</p>
               <q>Quales cauſae genere, &amp; forma comprehenduntur.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ramus</hi> doth <hi>commorari</hi> vpon this doctrine, ſhewing that a perfect definition doth lay out the ſubſtantiall quidditie of a thing: now the reaſon why hee ſaith <hi>genere,</hi> and not <hi>materia</hi> ſimply, but <hi>materia</hi> as it is in <hi>genere,</hi> is this, becauſe the <hi>genus</hi> containeth not onely the matter, but alſo a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16408:111"/>
of the forme, the generall forme: <hi>ergo,</hi> it muſt be the next <hi>genus</hi> that we muſt bring in a perfect definition, for if the <hi>genus</hi> be more remote, then the forme of the next <hi>genus</hi> muſt be left out: but if we take the next <hi>genus,</hi> then we bring in all aboue it.</p>
               <q>Et forma comprehenduntur.</q>
               <p>That is the ſpeciall forme: the reaſon in nature is this, we find that the <hi>totum</hi> is not <hi>ſubſiſtent</hi> but in <hi>ſingularibus:</hi> now we find moreouer that ſingulars haue that whereby they are ſingulars beſide, for elſe one ſingular could not be diſtinct from another, <hi>ergo,</hi> euery ſingular muſt haue his peculiar forme, and alſo his matter, not as it is a firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, but as it is <hi>ſymbolicè in genere.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Vt in animali, &amp; pars formae.</q>
               <p>He meanes of the generall forme, for <hi>anima vegetatiua,</hi> and <hi>ſenſitiua</hi> are the formes of <hi>viuens,</hi> and ſo of <hi>animal.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Totam formam hominis.</q>
               <p>As if the forme of man did conſiſt of theſe as of parts: but it is not ſo, the truth is this, there is in ſome things a ſimple life, in ſome things more liues, as <hi>anima vegetatiua</hi> is firſtly in <hi>planta:</hi> now <hi>animal</hi> hath that, and ſomewhat more, namely, <hi>ſenſitiua;</hi> and man hath both them and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reaſon, ſo that one of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> hath nothing, but that which the <hi>genus</hi> hath, namely, <hi>viuens</hi> and <hi>planta,</hi> for <hi>planta</hi> is <hi>viuens, quae viuit vitam tantùm vegetatiuam,</hi> and ſo is <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,</hi> onely <hi>tantùm</hi> makes the difference from others. Now from this diſcourſe he gathers, that a definition is <hi>vniuerſale ſymbolum,</hi> not that ſingulars cannot bee perfectly defined, as well as vniuerſalls, but he meanes it is a <hi>ſymbolum</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining vniuerſally the cauſes conſtituting the eſſence: ſo that the <hi>indiuiduum</hi> hath the matter, and forme of euery
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16408:111"/>
                  <hi>genus</hi> aboue him, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is <hi>vniuerſale</hi> in this reſpect, hauing his peculiar forme added to them.</p>
               <q>Naturam.</q>
               <p>Here wee may ſee what nature is in things properly: ſome make the forme onely to be nature, ſome the matter onely, and ſome both forme and matter: here we ſee the eſſence and nature are all one: in the firſt ſignification <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura</hi> ſignifies <hi>res nata:</hi> ſecondly, it ſignifies <hi>res vnde res na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta eſt,</hi> that is, the cauſes: ſo that here know that the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being put, all things attending them follow, for ſo <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> is taken for the properties of a thing. <hi>E qui dat formam, dat formam conſequentiam:</hi> ſo that a perfect defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition doth deliuer whatſoeuer comes within the name of nature.</p>
               <q>Tales definitiones ſunt artium.</q>
               <p>No not <hi>tales</hi> if we ſhould exactly try them by this rule, but they are the beſt examples.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue heard of artificial arguments, and there can be nothing that ſhall be in the <hi>artificio</hi> of any thing, but wee haue heard it: ſo that if wee looke at any of the creatures of God to ſee the root, the cauſes of it, and then the whole circumference and limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, wee may by theſe arguments taught before, ſee it throughly. Now whereas one man cannot ſee all things, though at the firſt all things were made for one man, the Lord hath in wiſedome ordained that wee ſhould receiue ſome things by reports from others, for as the world was to increaſe both in men and other creatures, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l e

that one man ſhould ſee all things <hi>intus &amp; in cute:</hi> ſo that whereas at the beginning all things being made for one man, and he afterwards could not ſee them, yet ſtill it is ſo farre forth true whileſt all men ſee all things. It is called <hi>inartificiale</hi> for the contrary reaſon, that <hi>artificiale</hi> was ſo called, namely of being in the thing, whereas this is not in the nature of the thing, but <hi>externè</hi> altogether: ſo that we may ſee his force by this, hauing no farther to doe with the thing, then onely by witneſſing of it.</p>
               <q>Expoſito artificiali argumento, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>This tranſition containes the concluſion of all that went before, and the propoſition of that which followes: and here againe wee may ſee how artificiall arguments goe before inartificialls, becauſe inartificiall arguments haue no ground, but as they are backt with artificialls. And this doctrine we may ſee to be true by the practiſe of common people, for if a man giue teſtimony of that hee knowes not, others will ſay he doth he knowes not what: for as no man can giue teſtimony of that he knowes not; ſo no man ought to receiue a teſtimony, but as it is backed with artificialls, otherwiſe he knowes not the thing ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, as hee ſhould, and if hee firſt heare a teſtimony of a thing, and afterward come to ſee the thing, hee will then ſay he knowes it, not becauſe one teſtified ſo much, but becauſe himſelfe ſaw it to be ſo; it is called <hi>argumentum inartificiale,</hi> becauſe it neuer comes into Art to make vp a rule, though it may come in as a commoration to proue a rule ſyllogiſtically, but method is the diſpoſition of axioms not of ſyllogiſmes, now a teſtimony of a thing belongs to that Art, to which the thing witneſſed doth belong: as <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> authority againſt the Creation of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Diuinity, there to bee confuted in the doctrine of the Creation.</p>

               <p>It is of power to argue as we heard before, but not <hi>vi ſua.</hi> For when a man beareth witneſſe of a thing, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, preſuming that hee is familiarly acquainted with the thing that hee witneſſeth: ſo that <hi>arguit,</hi> but not <hi>ſua natura:</hi> for alas, what harmonie is there betweene the witneſſer conſidered in his owne nature, and the thing witneſſed, conſidered in its owne nature? none at all: ſo that we muſt looke at either of theſe for their natures.</p>
               <q>Sed aſſumpta, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>So that by the force of ſome artificiall argument taken vnto it, it doth argue, <hi>ergo,</hi> this teacheth vs not eaſily to receiue euery teſtimony hand ouer head, but firſt to looke whether the <hi>teſtis</hi> be well acquainted with the thing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, otherwiſe as it may be an errour in him to giue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of a thing he knowes not: ſo may it bee no leſſe errour in vs, that receiue ſuch a teſtimony: this wee ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued in common matters among men, and it teacheth vs to receiue the teſtimonie of a man, not ſo much becauſe <hi>ipſe dixit:</hi> but becauſe wee are ſure he knowes the thing throughly.</p>

               <p>This inartificiall argument hath not this <hi>praecipuam fidem</hi> from it ſelfe, but as it proceedeth from him that is prudent, vertuous, and beneuolent. <hi>Prudentia</hi> is that skill a man hath to bring his rule, or any deduct from his rule to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, that is, if he be not ſimple, and ſilly to tattle, and prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he knowes not what, then <hi>praecipuam fidem habet:</hi> ſo that <hi>prudentia</hi> doth require diſcretion, and iudgement to know and deliuer a truth.

               <p>Againe, if he haue not vertue ioyned with his <hi>prudentia,</hi> that is, if he make not conſcience of witneſſing the truth, when he knoweth it, we ought not to receiue it: ſo that as he muſt be able to iudge of the truth, ſo muſt hee haue conſcience to vtter it.

for the <hi>teſtis,</hi> and the teſtimonie are arguments, and make but one axiome: why, one argument may bee an axiome, as a wiſe man is worthy reſpect: here a wiſe man is an ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome: but when it is a teſtimonie, it is not an axiome: true it is, that the <hi>teſtis</hi> ſpeakes <hi>rem teſtatam</hi> axiomatically moſt commonly, and that is the reaſon our author ſpeakes ſo often of <hi>veritas,</hi> here in this chapter, but as it is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, it is no axiome.</p>
               <q>Eſt diuinum vel humanum.</q>
               <p>Here is a diſtinction of teſtimonies, I dare not call it a diſtribution, for theſe parts belong not to a teſtimony, but as diuers <hi>modi,</hi> we know that <hi>diuinum teſtimonium</hi> is giuen from him, from whom nothing is hid, but that he ſees all things, the humane is not ſo: ſo that <hi>teſtimonium</hi> comes to be reſpected theſe two wayes. Now if queſtion be made, that <hi>diuinum teſtimonium</hi> is beyond all controuerſie, ſurely if God ſay it, we are to receiue it: for God is good, and knowes all, and no euill dwels with him, neither doth he wiſh euill to his. Man may ſay with the Academickes, <hi>hoc tantum ſcio, me nihil ſcire, ergo,</hi> if a diuine, and humane teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie be compared together, the humane is to giue place to the diuine: neither is there any diuine teſtimonie, but if we looke after it, we ſhall ſee it in the thing: ſo that a diuine teſtimony is moſt abſolute, not <hi>quatenus teſtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> but in reſpect of the <hi>teſtis:</hi> hence doe wee plead ſo much for the truth of the Scriptures: we ſay that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that which the Church deliuereth: becauſe God ſayes it to our hearts by his holy Spirit, this is <hi>diuinum,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſayes wee are to beleeue it, becauſe the Church ſaith it, but that is but <hi>humanum, ergo,</hi> not ſo excellent. Againe, they are not content to make the Church a witneſſe of the Scriptures, but moſt abſurdly the cauſe of them, but God as he is the author of them, ſo he is the witneſſer by his Spirit: and it is one thing to conſider God as the cauſe of them, and another to conſider him, as the <hi>teſtis</hi> thereof.</p>

               <p>Our Author brings deuilliſh examples, not diuine: and he might haue done much better if he had brought teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies out of Scripture, but the reaſon why he doth not is this, we know Logicke is a generall Art, of all things whatſoeuer, <hi>ergo</hi> the Scriptures not being receiued among all people, and hee regarding that which was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in vſe, as the Poets fables, and ſuch like, and that which was more generally receiued, <hi>ergo</hi> hee omits the Scripture.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Nowing that a humane teſtimony doth reſt vpon the artificiall arguments, it cannot be ſo ſtrong as <hi>diuinum</hi> is: yet it may be true. <hi>Eſt commune, aut propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> becauſe the more witneſſes it hath, the ſtronger it is: that which is teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one man alone is weaker, becauſe one man may ſooner be deceiued then many: he may ſee onely one artificiall argument, they may ſee more, yea all: ſo that as a diuine teſtimonie is to be preferred before an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, ſo a humane that is common, is to bee preferred and receiued before an humane that is proper.</p>
               <q>Commune vt lex, &amp; illuſtris ſententia.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lex</hi> a law, a rule which is receiued either by the whole world, as the law of Nations; or of ſome peculiar Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as the lawes of a priuate ſtate: and this hath leſſe force in it then the former, <hi>ergo</hi> if the witneſſes ſtand of more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and of one alone ſtill holding all of them prudent, vertuous, and beneuolent, we are to receiue that which is witneſſed by more men, ſooner then the other. Now then where the Church of Rome reaſons with vs, is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to goe to the Church, then to a priuate man? yes, but they muſt be prudent, vertuous, and beneuolent: againe, they muſt ſee the artificiall arguments of that witneſſe, for elſe if one man ſhall bring teſtimony from the word of God, we are rather to receiue his: elſe we prefer an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teſtimony before a diuine. Againe, if it bee an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teſtimony, and a humane teſtimony that we compare
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16408:117"/>
together, let not a priuate man ſtand vp to ſtirre with his meere teſtimony againſt a whole aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the Creed being generally receiued in all Churches, is this, becauſe it hath a diuine teſtimony, <hi>ergo</hi> next to the teſtimony of the Church, we are to prefer the common teſtimony, and then the priuate, as it doth not iarre with the common one.</p>
               <q>Illuſtris ſententia.</q>
               <p>For though it be not a law, yet is it generally receiued, as notable for truth: now he calls it <hi>illuſtris,</hi> oppoſing it to <hi>obſcura,</hi> which though it may haue truth in it, yet is it not ſo famous to be receiued. We ſay <hi>vox populi</hi> is <hi>vox Dei,</hi> becauſe all truth comes from him.</p>

               <p>For there are ſome lawes that are cuſtomes, and they are not written: indeed in ciuill affaires, it ſo comes to paſſe that we cannot ſee all, but are faine to leaue ſome things to cuſtome: yet there may bee ſome lawes written in our hearts, which we call naturall.</p>

The giue which we heard of before, was that affection of one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another, which the common Logicians call <hi>cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goria:</hi> but when they are put together in diſpoſition, they belong to iudgement: ſo that here we ſhall heare of nothing but laying of ſimples together, that is, of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with arguments; and that is either of two ſides, of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16408:121"/>
one argument to one, as in a ſimple axiome: or of three ſides together, as in a ſyllogiſme: or laſtly of axiomes one after another for the helpe of memory, which is methode: ſo that when we haue ſeene this, we may ſee the reach of our reaſon, and the rule of it.</p>
               <q>Adhuc prima Dialecticae artis pars fuit, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>This is a perfect tranſition, for it is long ſince we heard this diſtribution: our author ſaith <hi>in Inuentione,</hi> and then <hi>ſequitur Iudicium:</hi> ſo that he teacheth vs that the firſt part of Logicke is conuerſant about the inuention of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhewes vs that the firſt part of Logicke came to be called inuention by a metonimie of the ſubiect for the adiunct: ſo <hi>iudicium</hi> came to name the ſecond part of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke by a metonimie of the ſubiect for the adiunct: or if you will Inuention, and Iudgement came to bee the parts of Logicke by a metonimie of the effect for the cauſe, for ſo <hi>inuenire</hi> and <hi>iudicare</hi> are acts performed by the firſt and ſecond part of Logicke, which if <hi>Kickerman</hi> had well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered he would not haue reproued <hi>Ramus</hi> for this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</p>

                  <hi>Iudicium</hi> is properly the act of our vnderſtanding, as it doth diſcerne and determine truth and falſhood: for it comes of <hi>iudex</hi> a iudge: and when an axiome is made, our iudgement comes to iudge it: ſo that the name will in the end hardly be found large enough for this part of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke. I would rather diſtribute it thus, <hi>Dialecticae partes duae ſunt, Inuentio, &amp; Diſpoſitio,</hi> and then <hi>Diſpoſitio eſt iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, aut methodus:</hi> and <hi>iudicium eſt axiomaticum, aut ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſticum.</hi> My reaſons are theſe, firſt becauſe in method I ſee no more iudgement then in inuention, but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of the order of axiomes. Againe, iudgement is for truth, and falſhood, and that is the drift of axiomaticall, and ſyllogiſticall iudgement, <hi>ergo,</hi> they two are to bee coupled
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16408:121"/>
together. Againe, I obſerue this in nature, that there are there internall ſenſes, fancie, cogitation, and memory, for the common ſenſe is all one with fancie. Now theſe ſerue reaſon, as the two affections loue, and hatred ſerue will; for as there is the affection of loue to embrace that which will willeth, and the affection of hatred to hate that which will nilleth: ſo there is to ſerue reaſon, firſt a fancy that ſerues inuention; cogitation, and memorie that ſerue diſpoſition. Now theſe three are diſtinct in nature, becauſe their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and inſtruments by which they worke are diſtinct, for the organ or inſtrument of fancy is heat, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cogitation is drith, and moiſture of memory. Now the oppoſite to heat is cold, therefore cogitation, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory communicate in cold: then cold is a dry or moyſt cold, the dry cold is the inſtrument of cogitation, the moiſt cold is the organ of memory, but this cold muſt be but in a degree, for if it be too cold all is mard. Now then cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and memory communicating together in cold, there muſt be a <hi>genus,</hi> wherein iudgement and method muſt alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, &amp; that is <hi>diſpoſitio:</hi> So that as theſe organs are by nature ſeuered in man, ſo nature muſt ſeuer our reaſon into inuention, &amp; diſpoſition, &amp; diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into <hi>iudiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and <hi>methodus:</hi> and that theſe are diſtinct in nature many reaſons doe ſhew, for when a man is firſt borne, then is his inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beſt, his iudgement is beſt when he is paſt <hi>iuuenis,</hi> hee remembers beſt when he is a child, and then beſt for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, becauſe his head is then hotteſt; afterward beſt for iudgement, becauſe then his braine is dryeſt: firſt of all beſt for memory, becauſe his head then is moyſteſt: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine man in the morning remembers beſt, becauſe then his braine is moyſt by reaſon of the fumes that aſcend to the braine, when he ſleepeth; at noone hee is fitteſt for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, becauſe his braine is then dryeſt: at night he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents beſt, becauſe then his braine is cold: and as in the Sunnes courſe, her heat is moyſteſt in the morning, dryeſt at noone, and coldeſt at night: ſo is it with mans reaſon: ſo that the internall ſenſes are thus diuided: yet here doe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16408:122"/>
we rather admit of a dicotomie, becauſe elſe wee ſhould leaue out a <hi>genus,</hi> namely <hi>diſpoſitio.</hi> Againe, becauſe the ends of inuention, and iudgement are various: now it may ſeeme ſtrange, that Logicke teacheth theſe parts thus diuided: for if it bee true, that a childe hath his memory firſt beſt, then his cogitation, and then his fancy, why ſhould not method be taught firſt, then iudgement, and laſtly inuention? The reaſon is this indeed, if a childe ſhould haue vſe of his diſpoſition firſt, it would hinder his growth, for a child hath leaſt vſe of his reaſonable ſoule for a long time, becauſe it is an hindrance of the acts of the vegetatiue, and ſenſitiue ſoule, by reaſon hereof if he ſhould be moyſteſt, hee could not grow to that ſtature which is fitting: or if he ſhould bee dry, it would not extend his moyſture againe afterward; that his fancy is moyſteſt, it is for the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of the body, for moyſture is moſt praedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in him, till hee come to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of his age, and then his moyſture cannot extend it ſelfe by reaſon of his heat, and then hee becomes moſt iudicious: ſo that theſe are conararie to the order of method, for the good of man. Againe, a childe hath his faculty of memory principall, that then he may gather things into a ſtorehouſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he muſt come to iudge them: <hi>ergo,</hi> it is neceſſary that he ſhould haue the beſt memory firſt, not ſo much for the act of his reaſon, as for the growth of his body (he is for <hi>anima vegetatiua</hi> a plant: for <hi>ſenſitiua</hi> an <hi>animal</hi>) and yet there is no one act of any of theſe faculties aboue, but al act together: yet ſo as one is predominant: <hi>ergo,</hi> wee ſay old age brings wiſedome. Now wiſedome is <hi>ſapientia,</hi> that is, ſyllogiſticall iudgement; or <hi>prudentia,</hi> that is, the application thereof vpon euery occaſion. Againe, ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſticall iudgement is for axiomaticall iudgment, for when an axiome is doubtfull, wee vſe the light of a third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo going backe to the rule of true and falſe axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes, we iudge it to be true, or falſe: againe axiomaticall and ſyllogiſticall iudgement communicate in the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of arguments, whereas method diſpoſeth axiomes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16408:122"/>
arguments mediately; againe, method hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with ſyllogiſticall iudgement no more then with axiomaticall iudgement, <hi>ergo,</hi> wee heare how theſe ſhould be diſtributed from the organes of them in naturall Philoſophy, and from the very act of reaſon. Now for <hi>Kickerman</hi> who makes a tricotomy, he de ſiring to make a perfect Art leaues out a <hi>genus.</hi>

               <q>Diſpoſitio, eſt ſecunda pars Logicae de diſponendis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentis ad bene iudicandum.</q>
               <p>This terme <hi>diſpoſitio</hi> commendeth to vs the whole drift of the ſecond part of Logicke, that is, a diſpoſing, ſeuering, or putting arguments aſunder, it is <hi>pars Logicae,</hi> taking it for the doctrine of Logicke, it containes a portion thereof, which hath nothing to doe with inuention, I meane for precept, but onely for vſe, for inuention, and iudgement are as oppoſite as white, and blacke.</p>
               <q>Pars Logicae.</q>
               <p>For indeed it belongs to no other Art, no not to Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke for doctrine, but onely for vſe, for as for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>exordium, narratio, &amp;c.</hi> it is nothing but method: <hi>ergo,</hi> it doth not follow, that becauſe the Rhetorician vſeth diſpoſition, <hi>ergo,</hi> it belongs to Rhetoricke. The Orator, the Grammarian, &amp;c. are generall men, yet their Arts are diſtinct.</p>
               <q>Logicae.</q>
               <p>Becauſe Logicke is the rule of reaſons act, and there is alſo this ſecond act of reaſon to let vs ſee how God hath diſpoſed all things in nature: for ſo all things but God are compoſite, yet there are ſimples too; yes, but not in vſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent in themſelues, but euer with others: <hi>ergo</hi> Gods ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity is a property that cannot be communicated to any other thing.</p>

               <p>For there cannot bee a diſpoſition, till there bee things to be put together, as a Bricklayer cannot lay bricks together, except he haue brickes. Againe, we know Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar hath two parts, firſt Etymologie of a word alone, and Syntax of more words together: ſo here there muſt be of things, firſt a ſimple conſideration of arguments aſunder, and then a diſpoſing of them together.</p>
               <q>De diſponendis.</q>
               <p>Our author ſaith <hi>de diſponendis:</hi> ſo that this it is, the whole of theſe rules following is to diſpoſe things with things: or ſeeing God practiſe firſt in this rule, we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him: for if man be Gods ſteward ouer his creatures, it is requiſite he ſhould know them, that he may take them to his comfort.</p>
               <q>Argumentis.</q>
               <p>Surely it doth diſpoſe arguments but mediately not immediately, firſt it diſpoſeth axiomes, then arguments vnder axiomes, for elſe I doe not ſee how method will come vnder this definition, <hi>ergo,</hi> wee are to vnderſtand it thus <hi>de diſponendis argumentis,</hi> that is, of diſpoſing axiomes immediately, arguments mediately, as they make vp the axiomes.</p>
               <q>Ad bene iudicandum.</q>
               <p>This ſhould be left out, for it belongs not to method, for it is <hi>ad memoriam recolendum</hi> rather, <hi>ergo,</hi> we may leaue this out, yet he ſtayes vpon it, and giues the reaſon thereof <hi>certa enim diſpoſitionis regula vnumquodque iudicatur,</hi> this is true, but I deny that euery rule of diſpoſition tendeth <hi>ad bene iudicandu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> therfore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his problemes ſaith that a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16408:123"/>
man of great iudgement hath no great good memory, and the reaſon is this, becauſe their inſtruments are contrarie: ſo that <hi>certa,</hi> but not <hi>omni diſpoſitionis regula vnumquodque iudicatur.</hi> Now from this effect <hi>Iudicium, &amp; diſpoſitio pro eodem dicitur:</hi> yea but not rightly, and as I take it here <hi>Ramus</hi> was miſtaken: they that made this diſtribution of Logicke firſt, as <hi>Tully, Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> they knew not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but ſhut it out of Logick, otherwiſe they would not haue called this part iudgement.

               <p>Here queſtion may bee made, whether it may not bee <hi>diſpoſitio argumentorum cum argumentis,</hi> or <hi>argumenti cum argumentis,</hi> or <hi>argumentorum cum argumento?</hi> Yes, but if it be <hi>argumentorum,</hi> it is <hi>argumenti, ergo,</hi> this is more generall: ſo that he ſaith <hi>argumenti cum argumento,</hi> as in a ſimple axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome: or <hi>argumentorum cum argumentis, aut contra,</hi> as in a compoſite axiome: ſo here is the playing at two hand ruffe, for here are but two ſides in an axiome, <hi>ergo,</hi> in this reſpect he ſaith <hi>argumenti cum argumento, argumenti</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, becauſe all the kinds of arguments may be diſpoſed in an axiome.</p>

                  <hi>Enunciatum</hi> ſignifies the thing concrete, and <hi>enunciatio</hi> ſignifies the axiomation (as we may ſay) of it, the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and ſo of the reſt.</p>

               <p>We haue heard that there are but two ſides of an axiome, and to this end <hi>quaiudicatur aliquid eſſe, aut non eſſe.</hi> Now this axiome is diſtributed, firſt into his actiuncts, therefore <hi>affirmatum,</hi> and <hi>negatum</hi> attend vpon the <hi>eſſe,</hi> and <hi>non eſſe,</hi> which the axiome doth deliuer. <hi>Homo eſt animal,</hi> here <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid eſſe dicitur,</hi> and it is <hi>affirmatum: homo non eſt animal,</hi> here <hi>aliquid non eſſe dicitur,</hi> and it is <hi>negatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> ſo <hi>homo eſt lapis,</hi> here <hi>aliquid dicitur eſſe, &amp; affirmatur: homo non eſt lapis,</hi> here <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid dicitur non eſſe, &amp; negatur:</hi> ſo that the affirmation, and negation of an axiome is not of the <hi>eſſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>non eſſe</hi> of it.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16408:126"/>
then the <hi>ſpecies</hi> which follow ſhould be left out, for ſome there are which ſay a diſtribution is perfect or imperfect, euen as a definition is perfect, or <hi>deſcriptio:</hi> but that is falſe; for we vſe not a deſcription, when we can haue a perfect definition, but we vſe a diſtribution <hi>ex adiunctis,</hi> when we alſo haue a diſtribution <hi>generis in ſpecies.</hi> Againe, it is not imperfect, becauſe it cannot be a diſtribution of <hi>genus</hi> into the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or of <hi>integrum</hi> into the members imperfectly; for then <hi>affirmatum</hi> would ſignifie a ſimple axiom, and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum</hi> a compoſite axiom.

               <q>Affirmatum quando vinculum eius affirmatur.</q>
               <p>Why haue we not yet heard of <hi>vinculum?</hi> if here be his firſt place, why doth he not here deſcribe it? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe we heard that <hi>diſpoſitio</hi> was <hi>pars Logicae de diſponendis argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis,</hi> and that <hi>iudicium</hi> was <hi>diſpoſitio argumenti cum argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento qua eſſe aliquid aut non eſſe iudicatur:</hi> and in diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we haue this band, for though there be a <hi>poſitio</hi> of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, <hi>dis</hi> that is aſſunder: yet there is a compoſition too: ſo that wee haue it both in the generall definition of diſpoſition, and in the ſpeciall deſcription of <hi>Iudicium.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Vinculum.</q>
               <p>Now indeed <hi>vinculum</hi> is <hi>vox aequiuoca,</hi> for it is the band of an axiom, of a ſyllogiſme, and of method: the band of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16408:126"/>
method is called <hi>tranſitio,</hi> which ties two ſeuerall doctrines together, as two bankes that haue water running between them are tied together by a bridge, <hi>ergo</hi> in this caſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be defined.</p>
               <q>Vinculum affirmatur.</q>
               <p>Then we ſee that the affirmation of the axiom is from the band, and not from the arguments: and when wee ſay <hi>homo eſt lapis,</hi> and <hi>homo non eſt lapis,</hi> we haue a <hi>vinculum</hi> in both: though indeed where the arguments agree, there ſhould be an <hi>eſt,</hi> and where they diſagree, there ſhould be a <hi>non eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Negatum quando negatur.</q>
               <p>For if it be <hi>affirmatum, quando vinculum eius affirmatur,</hi> ſo <hi>negatum contra:</hi> ſo that here euermore looke to the <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum:</hi> now this diſtribution doth not require that wee ſhould alwayes affirme, and deny too the ſame axiom, and ſo looke at it, neither ſhall we alwayes finde it ſo, though it may be ſo; becauſe theſe are but adiuncts to an axiom, and where the ſame axiom is affirmed or denyed.</p>
               <q>Hinc naſcitur axiomatum contradictio, quando idem axioma affirmatur, &amp; negatur.</q>
               <p>So that in contradiction there is this peculiar, that the ſame axiom muſt be affirmed and denyed: ſo that the true place of contradiction is here: hee ſaith, <hi>Hinc naſcitur:</hi> whence? from the affirmation and negation of the ſame axiom. Now the reaſon why the ſame axiom may bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and denyed, is becauſe theſe are not eſſentiall to an axiom, and the axiom is the ſame whether it be affirmed or denied: the ſame it is alſo for <hi>eſſe,</hi> and <hi>non eſſe,</hi> but not for affirmation and negation: it is the ſame man that was in the morning cold, and warme at noone. Now here in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16408:127"/>
we are carefully to obſerue, that there bee a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, where we make one.</p>
               <q>Idem axioma.</q>
               <p>That is, the ſame arguments muſt be both affirmed and denied, one of another; and this wee muſt carefully looke vnto, elſe may wee contend <hi>de lana caprina.</hi> Againe, hee ſaid <hi>idem. Obiect. Homo eſt doctus,</hi> and <hi>homo non eſt doctus,</hi> are theſe the ſame arguments? yes, and the ſame axiom, but differing onely in quality: they are <hi>ſubiectum</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctum:</hi> but when I ſay <hi>homo eſt doctus,</hi> and vnderſtand it of <hi>homo,</hi> which is not <hi>doctus,</hi> as <hi>Thirſites,</hi> it is ſtill the ſame argument, but the arguments are diſparates.</p>

               <p>Here marke how <hi>contingens</hi> is defined by time: wee heard of time before in the doctrine of <hi>adiunctum, ergo,</hi> it hath nothing to doe here, <hi>ergo, aliquando</hi> hath not ſo much to doe with time, as it lookes after <hi>contingens,</hi> which may be <hi>verum,</hi> and <hi>falſum</hi> at ſeuerall times: for when a thing is once true, it cannot alſo be falſe, but <hi>diuerſis temporibus.</hi> Againe, when we heare of <hi>contingens falſum,</hi> there let vs leaue it; and now <hi>falſum</hi> is <hi>contra,</hi> but becauſe euery thing is firſt true before it be falſe, <hi>ergo contingens</hi> muſt bee defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>quando ſic,</hi> firſt <hi>verum eſt,</hi> and <hi>falſum</hi> afterward.</p>

It is a common opinion that whatſoeuer God decreed is neceſſary. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though it be true that Gods decree ſhall moſt ſurely come to paſſe, yet doth it not put a neceſſity, for then this neceſſity muſt lye in the things, not in the author of the things: ſo when we ſay his decree muſt come to paſſe, we meane it muſt be of neceſſity, that is, by coaction, and this alſo is falſe, for the Lord doth all things by counſell: ſo that here wee are to looke at the <hi>potentia</hi> in the arguments, and not to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <hi>potentia.</hi> The not diſcerning of this neceſſity <hi>ex hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſi,</hi> as they call it, and certainty, makes them take many things for neceſſary, which are not. So that to imagine ſuch a thing, is to ſay, that God doth not things <hi>conſilio:</hi> againe, to ſay ſo, is to make the Stoicks <hi>fatum,</hi> for their <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> was this, becauſe <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſaid ſo: ſo that if they ſay it cannot be otherwiſe, it is the Stoicks <hi>fatum</hi> directly.</p>

If a man would lay brickes with brickes, to haue them hold together, he muſt haue morter; and if he would faſten two peeces of wood together he muſt haue a naile, or a pin of wood: for as the morter is to the brickes, and the naile or pin to the wood, ſuch is this <hi>vinculum</hi> here ſpoken of to the arguments.</p>
               <q>Vinculo.</q>
               <p>He calls it <hi>vinculum,</hi> becauſe the <hi>vinculum</hi> holdeth the arguments together in a kinde of compoſition: imitating God therein, who hath tyed things in nature with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: and indeed to ſpeake the truth it ſprings from the affection that is betweene the two arguments diſpoſed.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16408:136"/>
is chiefly for contradiction: for if there be contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction here, the verbe muſt bee affirmed, and denyed: <hi>vt ignis vrit: ignis eſt antecedens, vrit conſequens:</hi> here he calls the argument going before the verbe <hi>antecedens,</hi> and the argument following the verb, <hi>conſequens:</hi> others call them <hi>ſubiectum,</hi> and <hi>praedicatum,</hi> but he is not pleaſed with their names, becauſe <hi>ſubiectum</hi> is properly an argument in inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore if it ſhould bee vſed here, it would breed confuſion: and not onely ſubiects and predicates are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed here, but all other arguments, therefore hee rather keepeth the generall termes ſhewing ſo much: againe, they are fitter, becauſe here we are in diſpoſition, <hi>ergo</hi> there muſt be an argument to goe before the <hi>vinculum,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow. Now we vſe theſe terms alſo in a compoſite axiome, but they are more proper here.

               <p>Here euermore contradiction diuides truth from falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: ſo that if one part be true, the other will alwayes be falſe, <hi>&amp; contra.</hi>

               <p>The axiome ſtands vpon the band, for wee haue heard of the arguments before, and that which is here new is the diſpoſing, or banding them together. Now according to the nature of a coniunction that tyes two ſides together, are axiomes to be diuided, for there are ſome coniunctions that belong to a ſyllogiſme tying three ſides together.</p>

to argue one ſide: <hi>ſegregatiuum,</hi> that is, where the parts that make one ſide are ſeuered, to argue the other ſide. Now the reaſon of this is plaine, for ſome things there are that may agree in nature, and ſome things that muſt be ſeuered, <hi>ergo,</hi> as God hath ordered his creatures, ſo muſt our Logicke behold them.</p>

               <p>Things diſpoſed together where there is two ſides are either diſpoſed, that is, yoked together, as oxen goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one by another, or as horſes are tyed taile to taile one following another in a teame. So that if the arguments be diſpoſed, that is, yoked together as oxen, then it is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate axiome, and if one argument goe before another, and the latter follow vpon the former, then it is a connex: ſo that as one thing in nature is diſpoſed together with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or as one thing followeth vpon another, ſo muſt our reaſon ſee them. A copulate is firſt, becauſe there is not ſuch a precedency, and conſequency of the arguments as in a connex, but both goe together, <hi>ergo,</hi> a copulate is next to a ſimple, and thence it is that a copulate axiome is ſo often in a ſimple ſyllogiſme.</p>

Now the parts of the antecedent are the propoſition, &amp; aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſo it is requiſite, that euery ſyllogiſme ſtand of three parts, becauſe they play at three hands: and there muſt be two parts of the antecedent, becauſe the argument being but one can play but twice, namely, with the two parts of the queſtion, and therefore if it ſhould play the third time, it muſt play with it ſelfe, and thence it is, that it neuer comes into the concluſion: now in a compoſite

we make a ſimple ſyllogiſme: or if the queſtion bee not ſo doubtfull but that we may ſoone perceiue it, then we make but a compoſite ſyllogiſme: hence it is that the common Logicians neuer dreamed of a compoſit ſyllogiſme, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a ſimple, deſiring to make all things more cleare, but there are often more fallaces lye lurking vnder a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſyllogiſme, then vnder a ſimple one: hence in ſchooles we ſay, diſpute <hi>catagorice,</hi> for in a compoſite the third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument being diſpoſed with the whole queſtion, doth not ſo cleare it, as in a ſimple it doth; yet none is to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, the compoſite ſyllogiſme cleares the whole que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the ſimple cleares both the parts of the queſtion.</p>

the propoſition thereof may be ſimple: affirmation, and negation we heard of in an axiome, but here the ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme is not ſo nominated from the band as before, but from the propoſitions affirmed, or denyed, generall, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or proper: ſo that affirmation is here when euery part, propoſition, aſſumption, and concluſion are affirmed.</p>

               <p>Our Author brings in a diſtribution here, that hath not any warranty from any other but himſelfe, hee thought long how he might make a dicotomy, which hee might haue done thus: a ſimple ſyllogiſme is more ſingle, or more compoſite, this hee thought of, but if he ſhould haue brought it in, then there would haue beene confuſion, for then he had ſeuered the explicates: becauſe there the third argument followes twice: whereas there are certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties agreeing to them both, which haue nothing to doe with a contract, Againe, I haue ſeene in ſome of his addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a tricotomy into <hi>contractus, explicatus, primus,</hi> and <hi>ſecundus:</hi> but this alſo would breed confuſion; for by this meanes thoſe properties that are generall to both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates would be left out: but in the end he ſettled in this, though <hi>Machelmeneus</hi> a french man, who ſaith he was his maſter, reports that <hi>Ramus</hi> deſired him to mend this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution: and I am ſure though he were his maſter, the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler was better then the maſter. <hi>Ramus</hi> ſaith it is <hi>contractus,</hi> or <hi>explicatus:</hi> which we are to iuſtifie thus; hee followes vſe, and vſe contracts this kinde of Syllogiſme more often
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16408:153"/>
then it explicates it: not that it is alwayes contracted, but ſometime it is explicated, as <hi>Ramus</hi> tells vs: yet this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes true, that when it is explicated it may be contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Paul</hi> contracts it, hath God forſaken all <hi>Iſrael?</hi> God forbid, I am an Iſraelite: this is it: <hi>Paul</hi> is not forſaken, <hi>Paul</hi> is an Iſraelite, <hi>ergo,</hi> all <hi>Iſrael</hi> is not forſaken: ſo that <hi>contractus</hi> is a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>ſyllogiſmus,</hi> becauſe vſe doth moſt commonly contract this kinde of ſyllogiſme: therefore becauſe it is true more often, then it is falſe, therfore let the truth be taught generally, and the exception come more afterward, becauſe that is more ſpeciall in vſe, the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate is neuer contracted, <hi>ergo,</hi> this oppoſition of them may ſeeme to make them oppoſite <hi>ſpecies.</hi>

               <p>That is ſubiected as inferiour to both the parts of the queſtion: it muſt be <hi>ſubiectum</hi> of the conſequent part of the queſtion in the propoſition, and <hi>ſubiectum</hi> of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent part of the queſtion in the aſſumption, if we expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it: ſo that remember that before in the definition of <hi>ſyllogiſmus ſimplex,</hi> and apply it vnto this: ſo that that which is here required is firſt a particular queſtion, then a third argument as a queſtion is ſubiected, and this is when it is contracted.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue heard that a ſimple ſyllogiſme did breake the queſtion, and the third argument was layd to each part, that is, to the conſequent part in the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and looked into that by the light of the third argument, and to the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent in the aſſumption. Now <hi>ſimplex</hi> was by vſe contracted, or layd out more at large. Vſe is <hi>artium magiſter</hi> ſaith the Schooles, and becauſe it was more often in vſe contracted, then explicated, <hi>ergo,</hi> it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that he ſhould teach vs the vſe of contracting it. This is in nature firſt, if we ſhall looke at placing the third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for to come before is before to come behinde, and to come behind is before to come before, and behinde. Now in a contract the queſtion is alwayes particular, and the antecedent part of the queſtion in like ſort doth alwayes agree with the third argument, becauſe the aſſumption muſt alwayes bee affirmed, ſo that doe but conſider thoſe two things, and you ſhall preſently know any contract ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme, and thus much of a contract, now we come to an explicate.</p>

               <p>The things here to bee conſidered are firſt in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, then in the concluſion: the propoſition muſt be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or proper, not particular, for then it is a breach of

this rule, and this fallace is very common euen in common talke, as for example.</p>
               <p>That that ties vs vnto Chriſt is the act of our faith.</p>
               <p>The imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe is not our act of faith ſaith one.</p>
               <p>Therefore it doth not tye vs vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Here the propoſition is not generall, for wee are made righteous, not for our faith alone, but for that wee are in Chriſt by faith: faith tyes vs as an inſtrument, but wee muſt take heed that wee giue not that to the inſtrument, which is due to the principall cauſe, for euen as my arme is tyed not to my ſinewes, or nerues, but is tyed to the whole body, and is a member of the whole, being tyed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the whole: ſo wee are as members of Chriſts body tyed to his Church, and are part of the matter, and forme of the whole, the matter is <hi>quatenus,</hi> we are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made of the <hi>ſemen</hi> of the word: the forme is the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirit holding all the members in <hi>ſemine,</hi> in that word vnto Chriſt, now there is no fallace more common then this, for if we haue a reaſon we bring it, neuer look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the concluſion how it will follow, <hi>ergo,</hi> let vs now well conſider it, that we bee no more deceiued, for thus one ſaith.</p>
               <p>We are adopted to be the Sonnes of God by the act of faith without Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe doth not make vs to be adopted ſonnes of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore this is as if I ſhould ſay, that whereby I am nouriſhed or liue is my hands, <hi>ergo,</hi> this is true, but yet I doe not liue onely by my hands, for then I ſhould feed on them; and ſo if wee looke at the inuention wee make that <hi>cauſa ſola,</hi> which is <hi>cauſa cum alijs.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16408:155"/>
Now for negation we heard of that generally before, that is, <hi>ex meris negatiuis nihil concluditur:</hi> ſo that it is generally true, that if the ſyllogiſme bee negatiue, the concluſion thereof muſt be negatiue: but particularity, and property are here to be vnderſtood: ſo that whether in a contract, or explicate, negation is generall, and by <hi>pars debilior</hi> wee are to vnderſtand both negation, particularity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, but more eſpecially particularity, and property; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity is <hi>debilior,</hi> then generality, becauſe there we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo fully determine of a thing. Now negation is more weake then affirmation, becauſe it is more generall, as when I ſay a man is not a ſtone, for here I goe far from the point of telling you what a man is, for yet he may bee any thing but a ſtone.</p>

               <p>For whilſt a ſyllogiſme ſtands in the diſpoſition of the queſtion with a third argument; and a ſimple ſyllogiſme is from breaking the parts of the queſtion, diſpoſing the conſequent in the propoſition, the antecedent in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, <hi>ergo,</hi> the <hi>ſpecies</hi> muſt be by reaſon of the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the third argument going before onely, or going behinde onely, or going both before, and behinde, <hi>ergo,</hi> they are very <hi>ſpecies</hi> of diſpoſition. Now there are <hi>ſpecies duae,</hi> for there are no more places for the third argument: it cannot goe after, and come before, as it may come before, and goe after, the reaſon is this, the conſequent part of the queſtion is the <hi>maius extremum, ergo,</hi> if that ſhould bee in the aſſumption, then how could the aſſumption bee taken out of the propoſition, whereas the <hi>minus extremum</hi> was there, for ſo the aſſumption would be bigger then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: and by this meanes the third argument in the propoſition ſhould be greater if it came after, then the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius extremum</hi> that ſhould there goe before it, whereas wee heard before that the conſequent part of the queſtion is
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:16408:156"/>
either more generall, or at leaſt equall to the third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and againe, it ſhould goe before in the aſſumption, though it bee greater then the <hi>minus extremum:</hi> ſo that there are no more places, it muſt either goe before both, and ſo be leſſe then both the parts of the queſtion: or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low both, and ſo be greater then both: or elſe it muſt bee a meane betwixt both.</p>
               <q>Prima, vbi argumentum ſemper ſequitur, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>For here is a more ſimple diſpoſition then in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond explicate, ſecondly, it is denied <hi>in altera parte,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the one part of the antecedent part, either propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or aſſumption: they muſt neuer both be denied, nor both affirmed.

               <q>Semper ſequitur.</q>
               <p>That is, the conſequent in the propoſition, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent in the aſſumption: ſo that if the queſtion bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue we may conclude it here, or in all the reſt: but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars where the third argument agrees with the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent may be onely concluded in a contract, as,

ſecondly, that it bee affirmed in the aſſumption: for the placing of the third argument, wee muſt know, that the place of it is double: firſt, it muſt be the antecedent in the propoſition; ſecondly, it muſt be the conſequent in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and it had his name <hi>medium</hi> from this ſyllogiſm principally, for in a contract it was placed before the parts of the queſtion, in the firſt explicate after them: here it comes betweene them both, and becauſe this kinde was moſt common, and a figure beſt knowne in Schooles, <hi>ergo</hi> hence came the third argument to be called <hi>medium:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the aſſumption muſt be affirmed, and herein it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with a contract; and here wee ſee what ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme may be concluded in an explicate: firſt, an affirmed of all ſorts, whether <hi>generalis, particularis,</hi> or <hi>proprius:</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a denyed of all ſorts, but not euery denyed; for if the antecedent part diſagree with the third argument, then it will be concluded in the firſt kinde of an explicate, and therefore <hi>argumentum antecedit</hi> the conſequent part of the queſtion, <hi>ſequitur affirmatum,</hi> the antecedent in the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we heard generally in a ſimple ſyllogiſme; as for example, the queſtion is whether profit attend honeſty, the third argument is <hi>iuſtum:</hi> for the propoſition, if it bee not well gotten it will not thriue: for the aſſumption, the truth of that appeares becauſe <hi>iuſtiria generalis,</hi> or <hi>virtus</hi> and <hi>honeſtas</hi> are all one.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue heard of a ſimple ſyllogiſme, and how it came to be ſimple: now it is called a compoſite, by reaſon the whole queſtion is placed in the propoſition with the third argument, now which goes firſt, and which goes laſt, we ſhall heare in the ſpecialls. Againe, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition muſt be affirmed, meaning the parts affirmed, and alſo compoſite, the aſſumption and concluſion are alwayes or at leaſt may alway be ſimple, and it is called compoſite, not ſo much in reſpect of the propoſition, but of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the whole queſtion with the third argument. Here we muſt not bring any part of the queſtion into the aſſumption, for if we bring in one part, we wrong the other part: and if we bring in the whole queſtion, we commit a tautology, making the propoſition and aſſumption the ſame; but the third argument muſt come into the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it is the light to cleare the queſtion, <hi>ergo</hi> it is firſt placed in the propoſition with the whole queſtion, then alone in the aſſumption: as if I ſhould ſay, this is it that is two foot long, do you marke it: or as if I ſhould ſhew you corne, and a buſhell together in the propoſition, and then afterward ſhew you a buſhell alone, and tell you that it is a lawfull one.</p>

               <p>That is a compoſite either where the propoſition is a connex axiome, or where the third argument and the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion are diſiunct.

in truth I hold <hi>dianoia</hi> and <hi>ſyllogiſmus</hi> to be all one.

firſt, for the propoſition, aſſumption, and concluſion are axiomes, and belong to ſome Art, therefore look whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the more ſpeciall argument in the axiome belongeth, and thither the axiome belongeth: and if wee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the reaſon why ſuch a thing is ſo, or not ſo, ſee where your rule is, and looke at the former axiomes, and you ſhall finde arguments for the proofe of any thing, and may ſo keepe them: as for example, <hi>otioſus eſt amator, Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus eſt otioſus, ergo Egiſtus eſt amator.</hi> The propoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to morall Philoſophy, for <hi>vitium</hi> is a vice, loue is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence the ſinne, and it is the affection of loue diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>ergo</hi> this breakes the ſeuenth Commandement, <hi>ergo</hi> this axiome belongs hither, for loue is the more ſpeciall. <hi>Egiſtus eſt otioſus:</hi> this indeed belongs to the hiſtory of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtus,</hi> but becauſe we haue it not, therefore wee may cary it to <hi>otium:</hi> ſo the concluſion belongs to morall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, to concupiſcence. Againe, ſyllogiſmes ſerue but for the clearing of the truth of axiomes, and then afterward we returne againe to the rule of an axiome to iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or falſe, and this is all that is required for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing arguments, <hi>ergo</hi> method is <hi>diſpoſitio axiomatum</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Againe, we neuer remember any thing, but we make an axiome of it. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But we remember words. <hi>Anſw.</hi> though it be true that ſome remember words very ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet they remember them as axiomes, for the word, and the thing ſignified by the word make an axiome. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But I ſuppoſe they know not the meaning of the words. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet the ſound or eccho of the word in his head, which is an adiunct vnto the word, and the word it ſelfe makes an axiome ſtill: ſo that method is onely of axiomes: and commonly they that ſo remember words haue little iudgement, and if all the axiomes of all things were layd downe methodically, wee ſhould remember all things methodically.</p>

The ſecond end <hi>memoria comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur,</hi> is true: ſo then the iudgement of all the parts of an Art for their conueniency, is nothing but the ſeeing of their conſention: for one axiome laid to another is <hi>ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> and <hi>adiunctum,</hi> and ſo we make but one axiome of them: now method makes all things one, and we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all things as one: &amp; therfore it is that the world is one, namely, by method; and the reaſon why we forget any thing, is becauſe we make one thing more things, for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſe is of one thing indeed. The reaſon why wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a man whom we haue ſeene before, is becauſe we remember the diſpoſition of the parts of his body, noſe, mouth, eyes, &amp;c. and ſo turning the glaſſe of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding vnto him againe, we know him, and if we would remember any thing, for our owne preſent vſe, let vs cary them home to their places, and wee ſhall not forget them: and here we may ſee that we doe not remember by taking the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things into our braine, and there lay them vp as in a cheſt, or let them hang as birds in a lime-twig, and are receiued by phancie firſt, as if it did faſhion them, then cogitation conſiders of them, and memory keepes them.

               <q>Sequitur diuiſio in ſpecies, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>But if there be a diſtribution of the ſubiect into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts, they muſt goe before <hi>diſtributio generis in ſpecies,</hi> as <hi>affirmatum,</hi> and <hi>negatum axioma,</hi> muſt goe before <hi>ſimplex</hi> and <hi>compoſitum,</hi> becauſe the adiuncts are <gap reason="foreign">

the ſame Art, for where there is <hi>diſtributio integri in mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi> there is ſeldome <hi>diſtributio generis in ſpecies,</hi> though there may be either of theſe, and likewiſe a diſtribution <hi>ex adiunctis.</hi>

               <p>He giues vs here a note by the way, that if the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion went long before, that then we ſhould vſe a tranſition from one part to another: ſo that here wee ſee the vſe of a tranſition, and that it belongs to method, and it is as it were a bridge to goe from one thing to another: and it ſerueth <hi>auditorem reficere, ac recreare.</hi>

                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:16408:172"/>Sic igitur Poeta generaliſsimum primo loco, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>That is, this muſt bee our care when wee doe any thing eſpecially if it be of importance, that we miſſe not this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: but that we place euery thing in his due order and method according to nature.</p>
               <q>Sic Ouidius in Faſtis, &amp;c.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>RAmus</hi> hath ſhewed vs what method is, and that it is but one: now this exact order thereof is then, when we deſire to teach any thing plainly.</p>
               <q>At cum delectatione motuve aliquo, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>If a man be to deliuer an Art, hee muſt exactly obſerue this method in euery point: but many times it falls out in diſcourſes that diſorder muſt be vſed, not for the doctrines ſake, but becauſe of the peruerſity of the hearers, for they often goe out of their way by reaſon of their weakneſſe; now this way is eſpecially when we reiect homogenies, as Orators vſe much to doe, and draw in heterogenies, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that variety doth delight.</p>
               <q>Sed praecipue rerum or do initio inuertitur, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>So as we ſhall ſee a rule come in like a morris-dancer, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> placeth many out of order.</p>
               <q>Itaque ad illam perfectae methodi, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>So then, as we heard in a ſyllogiſme, that there was an inuerſion of the parts, a ſuperfluity, and a defect: ſo here in method, <hi>haec imperfectior forma non ſolum detractis rebus mutila eſt, vel ſuperaditis rebus redundat, ſed ordinis ſui quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam gradibus inuerſis praepoſtera eſt.</hi>

This or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is very vſuall in Poetry, and very pleaſant in a tale, or fables, becauſe when we reade them wee cannot reſt quiet till we come to an end of them.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Sic (vt Homerus ait) Homerus Iliada diſpoſuit.</l>
